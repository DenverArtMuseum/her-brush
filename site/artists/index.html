<p>Compiled from research conducted by Andrew Maske and Patricia Fister</p>
<h3 id="daitsū-bunchi-大通文智">Daitsū Bunchi 大通文智</h3>
<p>1619–1697</p>
<p>Born Princess Ume no Miya, Daitsū Bunchi was the eldest daughter of Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596–1680). She  was a devout Buddhist and at the age of twenty-two, after a short-lived arranged marriage at thirteen, became an ordained nun of the Rinzai Zen sect. She took up residence in Enshōji (Temple of Infinite Light), a small temple in northeastern Kyoto, where she spent the next fifteen years. In the 1660s, Bunchi established a convent, named Enshōji as well, south of Nara, which offered Buddhist training to women devotees. Her personal religious practice was marked by asceticism. In addition to calligraphy, Bunchi’s surviving works include clay portrait sculptures, small plaques bearing embroidered characters, and Buddhist figure painting.</p>
<h3 id="ema-saikō-江馬細香">Ema Saikō 江馬細香</h3>
<p>1787–1861</p>
<p>Ema Saikō was a celebrated literati painter, calligrapher, and writer of <em>kanshi</em> (Chinese poetry). Born to a wealthy family of scholars, her talents in the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy were recognized from an early age. Saikō began her training with the Buddhist monk-painter Gyokurin (after 1751–after 1814) at the age of thirteen, and she later studied with prominent literati artists including Rai San’yō (1780–1832) and Uragami Shunkin (1779–1846). She was a central member of several kanshi societies—Hakuō sha, Reiki gin sha, and Kōsai sha—serving as the head of the latter two. Her verses were widely published, and her home in Ōgaki became a destination for literati from around the country.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Later in life, Saikō was honored with an invitation to Ōgaki Castle, in recognition of her painting.</p>
<h3 id="hashimoto-seikō-橋本青江">Hashimoto Seikō 橋本青江</h3>
<p>1821–1898</p>
<p>Hashimoto Seikō was a literati artist known for her calligraphy and painting in the <em>bunjinga</em> style (literati painting). Seikō’s oeuvre consists primarily of landscapes and paintings of plum, bamboo, chrysanthemum, and orchid (collectively known as the Four Gentlemen). She was particularly fond of depicting the latter, which she is said to have cultivated herself. While there are conflicting accounts, Seikō was most likely born to a wealthy family in Ōsaka. She studied calligraphy with Shinozaki Shōchiku (篠崎 小竹 1781–1851) and painting with Okada Hankō (岡田 半江 1782–1846). Seikō traveled widely throughout Japan, participating in literati circles and mentoring several students, including Kawabe Seiran (河辺青蘭 1868–1931). Her name is listed in the <em>Kokon Nanga yōran</em> (古今南画要覧 Compendium of Nanga painters, past and present), published in 1853. Seikō continued to paint well into her seventies.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But later in life, her mental health declined, and she died in poverty.</p>
<h3 id="hirata-gyokuon-平田玉蘊">Hirata Gyokuon 平田玉蘊</h3>
<p>1787–1855</p>
<p>Hirata Gyokuon was a famed professional painter most closely associated with the Maruyama-Shijō school. She was one of only twenty-two women artists commemorated in the publication by Shirai Kayō (白井 華陽 d. 1836), <em>Gajō yōryaku</em> (畫乘要略 Brief overview of the annals of painting [1831]). Born to a well-to-do cotton merchant family in today’s Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture, Gyokuon studied painting with literati artist Fukuhara Gogaku (福原 五岳 1730–1799) and later with Hatta Koshū (八田 古秀 1760–1822), a painter of the Shijō school. Following the death of her father, Hirata Gohō (平田五峰), himself a painter, Gyokuon (the second of four daughters) turned to painting to support her family. Her close relationship with the literati artist Rai San’yō (1780–1832) resulted not only in many collaborations but in widespread rumors of romance, which caused a sensation. Her many extant works reveal mastery of a broad range of subjects, including figure paintings in the meticulous brushwork popular in China during the Ming and Qing periods, as well as bird-and-flower paintings and other natural subjects, genre scenes, and large-scale murals for temples.</p>
<h3 id="kaga-no-chiyo-加賀千代">Kaga no Chiyo 加賀千代</h3>
<p>1703–1775</p>
<p>Fukuda Chiyo was born in the province of Kaga during Japan’s prosperous Genroku era (1688–1704). She composed her first <em>waka</em> at age seven, and her poems soon became known throughout Japan. She was best known as “Chiyo of Kaga” (Kaga no Chiyo) rather than by her full name. Chiyo became a nun in 1755 and was acclaimed for her <em>haiga</em>, abbreviated paintings that often incorporated haiku inscriptions (a similarly brief, yet profound, form of poetry). Chiyo’s most famous poem, “Morning Glory,” has been quoted and reproduced countless times, both in Japan and abroad. In fact, Chiyo’s hometown of Hakusan has made the morning glory its official flower in her honor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A morning glory,</em></p>
<p><em>taking over my bucket.</em></p>
<p><em>Must get water elsewhere then.</em></p>
<p>朝顔に　<em>asagao ni</em></p>
<p>つるべ取られて　<em>tsurube torarete</em></p>
<p>もらい水<em>morai mizu.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="kaji-of-gion-祇園梶子">Kaji of Gion 祇園梶子</h3>
<p>1600s–1700s</p>
<p>Kaji’s poetic talents were evident already in childhood, with examples of <em>waka</em> (a classical form of poetry) compositions surviving from her early teens. At the turn of the eighteenth century, she established the Matsuya teahouse in Kyoto’s entertainment district, Gion. The simple teahouse, comprising long wooden benches under thatched eaves, attracted a literary clientele, largely thanks to her renown as a poet and calligrapher. Kaji is said to have occasionally gifted her guests poetry slips (<em>tanzaku</em>) inscribed by her as a souvenir. A collection of Kaji’s waka poetry, <em>Kaji no ha</em> (Mulberry [or Kaji] leaves [or pages]) was published in 1707 by Miyazaki Ameishi (d. 1758). While she never married, Kaji adopted a gifted child, Yuri, who ultimately went on to manage the teahouse and became a famous poet and calligrapher in her own right.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> They, along with Yuri’s daughter, Gyokuran, came to be known as the Three Women of Gion.</p>
<h3 id="kamei-shōkin-亀井少琴">Kamei Shōkin 亀井少琴</h3>
<p>1798–1857</p>
<p>Kamei Shōkin was born into a prosperous family of Confucian scholars who served the daimyo of Fukuoka. At the age of nine, her calligraphy was shown at a local exhibition; at eighteen, she published a volume of ninety-four verses. Shōkin was listed in the 1831 <em>Gajō yōryaku</em> (Summary of painting criticism) and in the 1853 <em>Kokon Nanga yōran</em> (Compendium of Nanga painters, past and present).

<h3 id="kiyohara-yukinobu-清原雪信">Kiyohara Yukinobu 清原雪信</h3>
<p>1643–1682</p>
<p>Kiyohara Yukinobu was a prolific painter active in Kyoto in the early Edo period and a descendent of the centuries-long Kanō artistic lineage. Her mother, Kuni (国), was the niece of Kanō Tan’yū (狩野 探幽 1602–1674), one of the major artists of the Kanō school of painting. Her father, Kusumi Morikage (久隅守景 c. 1620–1690), was Tan’yū’s disciple. Yukinobu displayed rare talent from an early age and likely studied directly with Tan’yū. She married a fellow painter and student of Tan’yū’s, Kiyohara Morihiro (dates unknown). As part of the extended Kanō school, Yukinobu carried out commissions from the ruling warrior class, gaining fame and recognition in her own time.</p>
<p>As a professional painter, Yukinobu was trained in <em>yamato-e</em> (Japanese painting, a genre dating back to the Heian period) as well as Chinese academic styles (landscapes, bird-and-flower, and paintings of beauties), gracefully merging and alternating between the two in her works. Her extant paintings boast a wide range of subject matter and an evident focus on female figure paintings, both historical and mythological, from Japan’s and China’s lore.</p>

<h3 id="noguchi-shōhin-野口小蘋">Noguchi Shōhin 野口小蘋</h3>
<p>1847–1917</p>
<p>Noguchi Shōhin was one of the foremost Meiji literati painters. Her work was included in major exhibitions around the world, and she was named an official artist of the imperial household, the highest formal recognition for a Japanese artist. She was born in 1847 to a physician in Osaka. From the age of four, she showed an affinity for brushwork, and she began taking lessons from the painter Ishigaki Tōsan (1804–1876) at eight. In 1862, when she was sixteen, her father died, and Shōhin supported her family with her painting.</p>
<p>Shōhin and her mother settled in Kyoto in 1867, where she became the student of the prominent Nanga painter Hine Taizan (1813–1869). She also gained the attention of the budding statesman Kido Takayoshi, who invited her to observe the enthronement ceremony of the Meiji emperor in 1868 with him and his family.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> In 1871, Shōhin relocated to Tokyo, and in 1873, she was commissioned to paint eight <em>fusuma</em> (sliding door) panels for the sleeping quarters of the Japanese empress.</p>
<p>In 1875, she went to the town of Kōfu, where she met Noguchi Masaakira, and they were married in 1877. A few years later, after a failed business venture, they moved to Tokyo, where Shōhin’s artistic talents again became her family’s main source of support. In 1889, she was appointed Professor of Painting at the Peeresses’ Girls School (which later became part of the educational institution Gakushūin University). That same year, her work was exhibited at both the Fourth Exposition Universelle in Paris and the Japan Art Association (Nihon bijutsu kyōkai) exhibition, receiving an honorable mention at the latter. In 1893, one of her landscape paintings won a prize at the Chicago World’s Fair. In 1899, she was asked to instruct female members of the imperial court in painting, including imperial consort Fusako. In 1901, Shōhin was asked to paint fusuma panels for the imperial palace, and around 1904, she was named an Official Artist of the Imperial Household.

<p>Active 1700s</p>
<p>Ōhashi-dayu (“Grand Courtesan” Ōhashi) was known not only for her beauty and grace but for her elegant calligraphy. Active in the mid-eighteenth century, Ōhashi was raised in a fairly well-to-do warrior-class family and trained in music, poetry, tea ceremony, and incense appreciation. Her father lost his commission, however, and she was sold to the Shimabara pleasure quarters in Kyoto to help repay her family’s debts. She was eventually able to leave and marry a man who shared her love of the classical arts.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> After his death, she became a Buddhist nun.</p>
<h3 id="ōishi-junkyō-大石順教">Ōishi Junkyō 大石順教</h3>
<p>1888–1968</p>
<p>Ōishi Junkyō had begun a promising career as a <em>geigi</em> dancer in Osaka, but at age seventeen, she survived a brutal attack wherein both of her arms were severed. After recovering from her injuries, she worked in a traveling theatrical group, singing ballads, dancing, and performing comical storytelling. One day, after watching a canary feed its chicks with its beak, she was inspired to try to write by holding a brush in her mouth. She retired from the stage shortly thereafter and devoted herself to the study of painting and poetry.</p>
<p>Junkyō married the calligrapher-painter Yamaguchi Sōhei (1882–1961) in 1912 and had two children. The couple later divorced, and Junkyō supported herself and her children through painting and calligraphy. She also offered a counseling service for people with disabilities. In 1933, at age forty-five, she officially took the tonsure at Kongobūji on Mount Kōya.

<h3 id="okuhara-seiko-奥原晴湖">Okuhara Seiko 奥原晴湖</h3>
<p>1837–1913</p>
<p>Okuhara Seiko was born to an upper-level samurai family in Koga, north of Edo (now Tokyo). Seiko studied literature, calligraphy, and the martial arts and was a student of painter Hirata Suiseki (1801–1868). The Koga domain did not allow women to move elsewhere except with a family member, so Seiko was nominally adopted by an aunt who lived in an adjacent domain. Not coincidentally, that domain had no such movement restrictions on women, so a mere three days after arriving at the aunt’s home in the spring of 1865, Seiko departed for Edo.</p>
<p>Seiko soon began attracting followers and, in 1871, established the school Shun’yōgakujuku, with a dormitory for women pupils. The prominent Meiji statesman Kido Takayoshi (1833–1877) patronized Seiko, and in 1872, he arranged for the artist to have an audience with the Japanese empress, making Seiko the first female artist to do so.</p>
<p>Notedly, when the Meiji government issued an edict in 1871 that men had to cut their traditional topknots, Seiko took the opportunity to cut their own hair short as well. Seiko was also known for wearing dark kimono typical of men’s apparel.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> While the signature in the artist’s earliest paintings bears the feminine suffix -<em>joshi</em> (女史 woman scholar/artist), Seiko soon chose to omit it.</p>

Apparently born to an aristocratic family and orphaned as a child, she was raised in Kyoto, where she exhibited extraordinary talent in poetry, painting, calligraphy, and music. Ozū served as a lady-in-waiting, tutoring women in the Inner Chambers both for shoguns and for the imperial house. She likely served all three of the warlords known as Japan’s Great Unifiers (Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu). Generations of noblewomen emulated Ozū’s graceful style of calligraphy. Her calligraphy was so admired that copybooks of her script were produced and circulated throughout the remainder of the Edo period.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> She is known today as one of the greatest women calligraphers of premodern Japan.</p>

She took Pure Land Buddhist vows at age thirty-three after being widowed and losing all of her children.</p>
<p>Rengetsu’s name was included in the <em>Heian jinbutsu shi</em> (Record of Heian [Kyoto] notables), and two volumes of her waka were published during her lifetime. She associated with many painters and sometimes inscribed her poems on their paintings. Examples of such joint creations (<em>gassaku</em>) include those done with Mori Kansai (1814–1894), Tomioka Tessai (1836–1924), and Wada Gesshin (1800–1870). Midpoint in her career, Rengetsu began creating simple ceramic wares on which she either inscribed her poems with a brush or incised them with a stylus. Her wares were immensely popular in Kyoto, Edo (now Tokyo), and beyond.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

She eventually went to Edo (now Tokyo), aspiring to study under Tetsugyu Dōki (1628–1700). However, she was refused by him on the basis that her beauty would be a distraction to the monks in training. She was also turned away from the temple Daikyūan by the head priest, Hakuō Dōtai (d. 1682). In a pious act of determination, she pressed a hot iron to her face to devote herself to Zen practice. Taken by her fervor, Dōtai accepted her as a disciple, designating her as his dharma heir in 1680. Gensō later established her own temple, and the priest who had initially refused her, Dōki, presided at the dedication of her Nyoirin Kannon Hall in 1694.</p>

Machi eventually gained the name Gyokuran (徳山(池)玉瀾 1727–1784) and became one of the most important Japanese women artists of all time.</p>
