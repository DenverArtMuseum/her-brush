[{"content":"Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection takes a nuanced approach to questions of artistic voice, gender, and agency through more than 100 works of painting, calligraphy, and ceramics from 1600s to 1900s Japan.\nMany of the artworks will be on view for the first time to the public. Her Brush traces the pathways women artists forged for themselves in their pursuit of art and explores the universal human drive of artistic expression as self-realization, while navigating cultural barriers during times marked by strict gender roles and societal regulations. These social restrictions served as both impediment and impetus to women pursuing artmaking in Japan at the time.\nHer Brush showcases works by renowned artists such as Kiyohara Yukinobu 清原雪信 (1643–1682), Ōtagaki Rengetsu 太田垣蓮月 (1791–1875), and Okuhara Seiko 奥原晴湖 (1837–1913), as well as relatively unknown yet equally remarkable artists like Ōishi Junkyō 大石順教 (1888–1968), Yamamoto Shōtō 山本緗桃 (1757–1831), and Katō Seikō 加藤青湖 (fl. 1800s). These works bring forward the subjects of autonomy, legacy, and a person’s ownership of their individual story.\nInteractive components facilitate a personal, intimate connection between the visitor, the artwork, and the artist. Paintings, calligraphy, and ceramic works of art are presented through the lens of the exceptional individuals behind them, with biographical focuses that tell the stories of their makers interspersed throughout the galleries. On view November 13, 2022, through May 13, 2023, this exhibition is included with general admission.\n","id":0,"length":235,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"Since an initial gift in 1915, the Denver Art Museum has built an expansive and rich collection of Asian art that allows us to display a versatile array of art from across the continent, and in particular from Japan. With the recent generous gift of Dr. John Fong and Dr. Colin Johnstone, the museum is now able to uniquely emphasize our collection of ceramics and ink paintings by Japanese women artists from the 1600s to the 1900s.\nCollected over decades, this extensive collection, including a study collection, consists of about 550 objects and lends itself to a range of exhibitions, research projects, and the study of connoisseurship. Encompassing art by Buddhist nuns, teashop owners, and literati artists among others, the collection allows us to tell a more comprehensive and inclusive story of art in early modern and modern Japan that illuminates the roles and successes of women artists. We hope to bring these artists to the public’s attention both through special exhibitions and in our permanent galleries.\nThe Denver Art Museum is proud to open its doors to students and researchers and is committed to developing educational programs aimed at advancing the field and promoting the study of these underrepresented artists. Experts and students are invited to examine and handle rare and important works alongside a wide range of copies (some made during the artists’ lifetime and some later imitations), through programming and object workshops geared at honing skills of connoisseurship.\nThis larger project prompted by Drs. Fong and Johnstone’s gift has led to the museum’s first digital publication. Freely available online to anyone interested, the digital catalog furthers the museum’s commitments to raising awareness and to equity and accessibility.\nI would like to thank Tianlong Jiao (former Joseph de Heer Curator of Asian Art) and Professor Andrew Maske (Wayne State University) for inviting Dr. Fong and Dr. Johnstone into the museum’s orbit and initially conceiving of an exhibition. Einor Cervone, Associate Curator of Asian Art, and the museum’s curatorial and exhibitions teams transformed those initial forays and research into a beautiful and engaging exhibition, Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection. Finally, I am grateful for the support of the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation, the Blakemore Foundation, the donors to the Annual Fund Leadership Campaign, and the residents who support the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD).\nChristoph Heinrich Frederick and Jan Mayer Director\n","id":1,"length":400,"title":"Director’s Foreword","type":"page","url":"/forward/"},{"content":"Introduction Why is it that you’ve never heard of Katō Seiko?\nHow about Yamamoto Shōtō or Kō (Ōshima) Raikin? It is not that they weren’t well known. They were, quite so, both during their own lifetimes and in generations that followed. The brilliance of their work, too, stands the test of time—whether in Seiko’s sprightly jubilations of finches among verdant blades of bamboo (fig. 1); in the measured steps of a weary countryman, returning home in autumnal twilight over Raikin’s brushed steps (fig. 2); or in Shōtō’s golden gossamers, malachite pools, and rushes of ink that give form to her supramundane chrysanthemums (fig. 3).\n       Expand fig. 1: Katō Seiko 加藤青湖 (active 1800s), Sparrows and Bamboo (detail), about 1872.

(23.2 × 18.7 cm). Gift of Drs. John Fong and Colin Johnstone, 2018.216.  These are only some of the names whose absence from the ledgers of art history has summoned this project.\nThe exhibition Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection (November 13, 2022–May 13, 2023) marks the inauguration of a multipronged project with a twofold objective: representation and accessibility. To achieve these goals, it leverages an expansive collection of calligraphy, painting, and ceramics, largely by women artists from early modern and modern Japan.\nThis all began with a gift.\nIn 2018, Dr. John Fong and Dr. Colin Johnstone pledged their collection of over five hundred works of Japanese art to the Denver Art Museum. Tianlong Jiao (Palace Museum Hong Kong), then Joseph de Heer Curator of Asian Art, along with Professor Andrew Maske (Wayne State University), a specialist of Japanese ceramics, conceived of an exhibition focusing on one of the main strengths of the Fong-Johnstone Collection: works by women artists dating from the 1600s to the 1900s. In line with the museum’s commitment to collecting and exhibiting underrepresented art and artists, the proposal was embraced wholeheartedly.\nResearch and preparation were underway when all work on the exhibition abruptly ground to a halt with the pandemic outbreak and curatorial changeover. Themes of artistic volition and inclusivity came to the fore, and a reckoning with an altered cultural landscape made the exhibition all the more relevant. The project as a whole seeks to bring awareness to this long-overlooked group of artists by shifting exhibition priorities and through ongoing commitment to focused programming, academic symposia, and artist engagement.\nThe Fong-Johnstone Collection, which according to the collectors, was itself inspired by the formidable art dealer Alice Boney (1901–1988), has been little studied and never shown. It holds many mysteries and questions, from identification to authenticity (figs. 4 and 5). It is, therefore, an invaluable resource for the study of connoisseurship. Addressing the steadily narrowing opportunities of in-person access to artworks, the Fong-Johnstone Collection and the Study Collection will ultimately be made fully available for study—both online and in person. It will provide opportunities to delve into questions of authorship and authenticity and to consider the nuances of connoisseurship.\n       Expand fig. 4: Artist unknown (signed Kiyohara Yukinobu 清原雪信, active 1600s–1700s), Genji Peeping at the Young Murasaki, 1600s. Ink and color on silk, 15¼ × 21½ in. (38.7 × 54.6 cm). Gift of Drs. John Fong and Colin Johnstone, 2018.255.

The catalog presents new research, detailed exhibition and object content, and supplemental materials that shed light on the artists and their lives. In response to the dearth of information in Western languages, it also takes a self-reflexive approach, contextualizing the exhibition and considering the subject through a multidisciplinary framework. Leading scholars, artists, and specialists weigh in on the state of the field—past, present, and future.\nPatricia Fister, who spearheaded the field in the 1980s and dedicated her career to the study and exhibition of Japanese women artists, has contributed an important essay. “Calligraphy, Poems, and Paintings by Japanese Buddhist Nuns” offers rare insights into artistic production by Buddhist nuns in early modern and modern Japan. A case study by Cervone, “On the Fong-Johnstone Study Collection and the Power of Access,” reconsiders questions of authenticity and its spectrum—from homage to forgery. How might we understand the cultural nuances of authorship? How might a copy shed light on the historical and contemporary demand for a given artist? Interpretive specialist Karuna Srikureja, in her essay, “xxx,” shares and explicates the interpretive strategies and methodologies developed and applied by the Learning and Engagement team at the Denver Art Museum to make Her Brush an inclusive, impactful, and relevant experience.\nIn short essays, scholars and specialists participating in the symposium, New Approaches to Gender and Agency in Japanese Art (February 25, 2023), add their voices to the ongoing discourse. Patricia Fister shares her journey and contributions to the study and exhibition of women artists in Japan; Melissa McCormick exemplifies research approaches to word and image in Ōtagaki Rengetsu’s art; Alison Miller contemplates gender and identity in Noguchi Shōhin’s artistic persona; Amy Beth Stanley addresses historiographical approaches to archival materials and the feminine voice in early modern Japan; Marcia A. Yonemoto questions gendered divides between art and craft, artist and artisan; and Paul Berry offers his thoughts on the current state of the field.\nFinally, this catalog brings voices of two contemporary artists and their responses to works in the collection. Denver-based Sarah Fukami’s contemporary take on portraits of several of the showcased artists is discussed in Srikureja’s essay. Beginning March 8, 2023, internationally acclaimed Kyoto-based artist Tomoko Kawao will pursue her multiyear and global Hitomoji Project: Women at the Denver Art Museum, with the support of Art Collective SML|k. Kawao’s public performance (March 21, 2023) will be recorded in the publication as well.\nIn short, this ongoing project is both a promise and an invitation. It is the museum’s commitment to advancing the field through this collection. And it is an invitation to you—whether you are a student, an educator, a specialist, or simply curious—to explore, contribute, engage, and to make this art your own.\nEinor Cervone\nAssociate Curator of Asian Art\n","id":2,"length":1110,"title":"Introduction. Introduction","type":"page","url":"/intro/"},{"content":"There have been quite a few key players in bringing this project to fruition. Some, I have never met. Dr. John Fong and Dr. Colin Johnstone, whose generous gift sparked this endeavor, credit the keen-eyed Alice Boney (1901–1988) as the instigator of their collecting journey. She was the first to introduce them to works by Japanese women calligraphers, painters, and ceramicists. Boney, an intrepid and adventurous art dealer, flouted all challenges and norms in her globetrotting through Japan, India, Thailand, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. Elegantly navigating a world dominated by men, she carved a space for herself in the art market of the 1930s and continued to dominate it for over six decades.\nPatricia Fister has done the same on the academic stage, spearheading a field completely her own. This current project remains profoundly indebted to her robust research and groundbreaking 1988 exhibition, Japanese Women Artists 1600–1900, which laid the foundation for the study in the English language of art and gender in early modern and modern Japan. Her scholarship reverberates through every corner of the gallery*.* We owe Fister’s involvement to Andrew Maske (Wayne State University) and Tianlong Jiao (Palace Museum Hong Kong), then Joseph de Heer Curator of Asian Art at the Denver Art Museum. They proposed and facilitated the transformative Fong-Johnstone gift and initiated the exhibition. Maske’s groundwork, moreover, informs much of the exhibition text.\nOur secret weapon, Patricia Graham, researched the objects tirelessly and enlisted an army of specialists who, in turn, worked around the clock and around the world to make this exhibition possible, despite its demanding timeline. These formidable scholars include Paul Berry, Martha J. McClintock, and several anonymous contributors. I am indebted to Hollis Goodall, Yurika Wakamatsu, and Kit Brooks for their words of advice, direction, and support. We are humbled by the enthusiastic participation and encouragement of speakers in the forthcoming scholarly symposium (February 25, 2023), including Melissa McCormick, Marcia Yonemoto, Amy Stanley, and Alison Miller, as well as Paul Berry and Patricia Fister, who will add their knowledgeable voices to the discourse. John Todd, Senior Associate at WOJR: Organization for Architecture, graciously offered his time and expertise, inspiring the design concept for the 2022 exhibition. A special thanks goes to the internationally renowned calligrapher Kawao Tomoko, for the beautiful calligraphy that graces the exhibition design and for agreeing to start the North American leg of her global, multi-year Hitomoji Project: Women in Denver. Kawao’s stay is made possible thanks to the generous support of artist and activist Sammy Lee and Studio SML | k, which continues to push the envelope of how art can change us.\nNow, come those whom I have grown to know closely since joining the work on this exhibition. First and foremost, is project manager and exhibition designer Eric Berkemeyer, who did not buck at any outlandish vision or bizarre pipedream thrown his way. He made the impossible possible, translating impalpable notions into a mesmerizing gallery design and oversaw all the moving parts of exhibition planning. I am grateful for Christoph Heinrich, Frederick and Jan Mayer Director, and Chief Curator Angelica Daneo for their foresight and faith in this project and for the support of my wonderful department colleagues, Hyonjeong (HJ) Kim Han, Joseph de Heer Curator of Asian Art, and Douglas Wagner, Curatorial Associate. Interpretive Specialist Karuna Srikureja has taught me so much about the art of speaking to a diverse body of visitors. Lindsay Genshaft and Ariana Robles have made this exhibition relevant and fun for our youngest visitors. Clara Ricciardi’s translations continue to bring this material to a wider audience. The indefatigable managing editor, Valerie Hellstein, separating wheat from chaff, crafted meandering sentences into cogent thoughts.\nArianna Flory, Curatorial Assistant at Large, has saved the day time and again. It seems like the mantra of our IT team, Derek Sava, Levy Smith, Cordelia Taylor, and Tim Taylor is forever “this has never been done before. Let’s do it.” Our talented photographers, Christina Jackson and Eric Stephenson have brought out the beauty and captured the spirit of the artwork. Matt Roe’s and Jenn Goodrich’s graphic design gave form to formless notions. The installation team has worked tirelessly behind the scenes. Without you, an exhibition is nothing more than some doodles in a notebook. Matt Popke and team have translated this complex and multifaceted enterprise into an arresting digital publication. Finally, I am grateful for my family, Dan and Damian, for their support and love.\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Her Brush is the fruit of dedication and hard work of this extended family I am now fortunate to call my colleagues at the Denver Art Museum.\nEinor Cervone\nAssociate Curator of Asian Art\n","id":3,"length":780,"title":"Acknowledgments","type":"page","url":"/acknowledgements/"},{"content":"","id":4,"length":"","title":"Video interview/walk-through with Paul Berry (TK—not until after the symposium/Quire launch)","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":5,"length":"","title":"Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection, Exhibition Text","type":"","url":""},{"content":"Preamble How do we leave our mark?\nHow is art a reflection of our personhood?\nA mirror into our soul?\nThis exhibition traces the pathways that Japanese women artists forged for themselves in their pursuit of art.\nFollow them into some of the realms within which they found their artistic voices—such as courts and castles, Buddhist convents, and literati circles (intellectual cliques).\nThe artists shuttled through these realms, rendering their borders porous—no small feat at a time marked by rigid societal stratification, stringent gender roles, and class expectations.\nWe refer here to their gender identity as women.

She was a revered colleague and mentor of both male and female artists. So admired for her poetry, calligraphy, painting, and ceramics, forgeries appeared already in her lifetime.\nDespite her popularity, much of her life remains a mystery. Purportedly the illegitimate daughter of a samurai and a courtesan, her given name at birth was Nobu. She was then adopted by the Ōtagaki family. Starting at age seven, Rengetsu served as a lady-in-waiting at the castle of a daimyo (feudal lord), where she trained in various arts.\nFollowing the loss of her husband and children to illness, she became a Buddhist nun.

In fact, becoming a nun literally translates to “leaving one’s home” (shukke 出家).\nTonsure did not mean, however, relinquishing one’s autonomy. On the contrary, it offered a form of liberation from societal expectations, such as The Three Obediences (of a woman to her father, husband, and son). It also enabled nuns to travel freely in times of state-imposed restrictions, which especially impacted women. Above all, it allowed them the freedom to pursue their art.\nWomen from all walks of life took the tonsure, from princesses (like Daitsu Bunchi) to entertainers (like Ōishi Junkyō). Still, this was an extremely difficult path to take and often entailed unimaginable determination.\nLeaving their old names behind, taking new names as ordained nuns, these artists crafted new identities for themselves.\nThe nun-artist Ōtagaki Rengetsu is seen here brushing a poem onto her ceramics.

The term alludes to the hedonistic and ephemeral nature of this realm.\nAs was the case when becoming a nun, entering this sphere—whether as a musical performer (geisha), an actor, or a sex worker—meant leaving behind one’s name and constructing a new persona.

In art as in life, Seiko found a unique artistic identity with bold individual brushwork, which caused a sensation in Edo’s literati circles and beyond.\nOne of the period’s most influential literati artists, Seiko founded a school and had hundreds of followers belonging to all walks of life—from government officials and geisha to roaming samurai.\n###Noguchi Shōhin 野口小蘋 (1847–1917)\n       Expand          Expand    “Good wife, wise mother”\n—Popular aphorism in Meiji-era Japan\n Noguchi Shōhin burst onto the literati art scene right at the tail end of Okuhara Seiko’s heyday.

The inclusive pronoun “we” collapses the distance between the questioner and the questioned, humanizing the museum voice and offering some authority back to the visitor. These questions prime visitors to enter Her Brush not to simply absorb information but to reflect, feel, and be an active participant in their experience. The exhibition design makes use of dramatic lighting, creative object display, and multiple textures and materials to create an immersive, evocative space that engages the senses and imagination. The invitation to participate is reinforced throughout the exhibition. Visitors are encouraged to open tanzaku boxes and collect artists’ biographical slips stored within them, make their own tanzaku, and even leave trails of digital ink on the exhibition walls through an interactive projection.\nThis approach is characteristic of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), which has been at the forefront of the movement toward visitor-centered museums for decades. Since the early 1990s, the DAM has employed a team-based approach to exhibition design built on the partnership between a curator and an educator (originally called a master teacher, now an interpretive specialist), championed by the then-director of education, Patterson Williams. This marriage of pedagogical and visitor-centered expertise with art-historical scholarship results in exhibitions that consistently push the boundaries of what it means to be a welcoming and accessible resource to the public.\nWith this institutional inheritance in mind, curator Einor Cervone and I were presented with a challenge in Her Brush. This exhibition had the potential to be incredibly alienating to a general audience: it explores a large swath of Japanese history (1600s–1900s) across varied genres and social realms, often diving into the cultural nuances that allowed women to pursue artistic careers. Despite this, the story we hoped to tell is an exceedingly human one. It is a story about resilience, self-actualization, and the universal drive to create. But how to tell this story when these artworks have become so far removed from the conditions that created them? This is the central challenge of art interpretation, which the noted philosopher and educator John Dewey articulated in his seminal Art as Experience (1934). To Dewey, “[The] task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognized to constitute experience.”1\nThe interpretive elements we created present art-historical detail in the service of personal connection. Biographical focus moments, for example, bring together an artist’s words, work, signature, and story and encourage visitors to see each artist as an individual with unique experience instead of the nebulous notion of the artist.\nWhile we wanted to privilege the artists’ experiences, we recognized the limitations of our own familiarity with their circumstances. Several of the highlighted artists in the exhibition dealt with challenges related to trauma, gender, and national and religious identity. While the exhibition team approached these artists’ experiences through a historical lens, many visitors face related challenges today and would bring their own vulnerabilities and preconceived notions to the exhibition. To help us navigate these key issues, we convened a group of local stakeholders. This group of community consultants included people from a range of backgrounds, including a disability rights lawyer, a Zen-based psychotherapist, Denver-based Japanese nationals, and Japanese American artists. The goal was not co-curation but rather gaining a nuanced understanding of the priorities and concerns of vulnerable communities represented in the exhibition. We sought to craft an approach that framed these historical stories in a way that was sensitive to our twenty-first-century cultural climate.\nThis sense of personal connection, to be sure, must be made available to audiences of all backgrounds and circumstances. Like all exhibitions at the DAM, Her Brush is almost fully bilingual, with texts in both English and Spanish. Cognizant of the large variety of ways in which individuals process information, we strove to create an embodied, sensory exhibition experience. An interactive activity in the final gallery translates visitors’ motions into ink strokes projected onto the wall, inviting them to literally embody an artist (fig. xx). The goal was for visitors to understand the connection between the body, artmaking, and self-expression and to experience the intimacy, joy, and physicality of creating and sharing art with others.\nWe made special effort to welcome kids and families into Her Brush. Denver-based artist Sarah Fukami had developed five collectable “artist slips” placed in tanzaku boxes around the exhibition (figs. xx–xx). On the back is a brief account of the artist, written in the first person, and a prompt leading to the next slip. A take-home folding screen bears six slots: five for the collectable artist slips and one for a slip produced by the visitor. An artmaking corner midway through the exhibition allows everyone to place themselves within this artistic lineage.\nUltimately, art museums exist at the nexus of learning and leisure; visitors therefore generally do not view the museum-going experience with the same goals of mastering content as one would expect from, say, a lecture or a book. It is with this conviction that we approached the exhibition interpretation and visitor experience for Her Brush. By adding emotional relevance to historical content, by enhancing narrativity, we allow information—otherwise inaccessible, intimidating, even—to ring salient and memorable.\n  John Dewey, Art as Experience (New York: Minton, Balch \u0026amp; Company, 1934), TK. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":13,"length":925,"title":"Galleries as Sites of Connection: Visitor Experience in Her Brush","type":"essay","url":"/exhibition/karuna/"},{"content":"","id":14,"length":"","title":"Works in the Exhibition","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":15,"length":"","title":"Sake Decanter","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":16,"length":"","title":"Autumn Landscape","type":"","url":""},{"content":"","id":17,"length":"","title":"Her Brush: New Approaches to Gender and Agency in Japanese Art: A Symposium","type":"","url":""},{"content":"Reading an Archive of Everyday Life In 2008, as a beginning assistant professor at Northwestern University planning my first survey course on the history of the Tokugawa era (1600–1868), I wanted to assign more readings on everyday life in villages. At the time, there were not many primary sources available in English, so I decided to translate some representative documents from the Niigata Prefectural Archives. On their website, I found the “Internet Document Reading Course,” a series of transcriptions and explanations of materials in their archive. It was there I first encountered the writing of a woman named Tsuneno, a daughter of a temple family from the tiny village of Ishigami in Kubiki County in Echigo Province. She had run away to the shogun’s capital of Edo in 1839, and in the letter that the archive had on display, she wrote to her mother to describe her new life as a maidservant in the theater district. “Everything in Edo is delicious,” she said.\nTsuneno’s voice was so simple and direct that I could hear it in my head. But it sounded suspiciously modern and straightforward. Could this really be the writing of a nineteenth-century Japanese woman? In my previous reading in Tokugawa history, I had encountered the abject, awkward prose of a post-station prostitute; the elevated, poetic language of samurai women’s travel diaries; and the matter-of-fact, efficient lists in merchant wives’ household accounts. I was unprepared for Tsuneno’s style, not only how it looked on the page—dashed off, confident—but also its forcefulness.\nI went to the archive in person and read Tsuneno’s other correspondence, which was preserved in her family’s papers (the Rinsenji monjo). I noticed that her favorite word seemed to be “I” (watakushi), and her letters often took the form of demands: “send me my clothes,” “go get the money I left with my uncle,” or “redeem my things from the pawnshop.” While she used traditional women’s forms, writing in kana and ending her letters with the respectful closing kashiku, she was never self-effacing. Her writing changed my ideas about how Tokugawa-era women thought about themselves. Never again would I believe that women were so enmeshed in the household system and so deeply embedded in their communities that they did not consider their individual desires. Tsuneno realized that her own ambitions and her family’s priorities were different, and though she often felt conflicted, she usually chose to pursue her own goals.\nTsuneno’s family’s archive contains over two thousand documents in a variety of hands. The men wrote in the epistolary style (sōrōbun), using complicated Chinese characters and occasionally referencing Buddhist doctrine. The family’s secretary wrote in the same style, and his drafts of outgoing correspondence survive, showing where he crossed out a phrase and reconsidered the wording. One correspondent, a man from the village doing seasonal work in Edo, wrote in a dark, blocky hand and employed a strange orthography, using characters in unexpected ways. Like Tsuneno, who rendered her own dialect in kana, he “spelled” phrases as they must have sounded to him. Meanwhile, Tsuneno’s aunt wrote in a graceful and feminine style, and her two sisters wrote in a hand that looks just like hers.\nThrough this remarkable archive, I encountered not only a variety of forms of writing but also a multitude of perspectives on everyday life. I could see, in these letters, lists, and diaries, how people of different genders and classes kept track of their daily business. I could follow a story of books lent, taxes owed, marriages planned, servants hired, children welcomed, and deaths mourned. Those dispatches from a vanished world were mundane and not always beautiful—there were blots and stains, miswritten characters, torn pages, and worm holes—but they were vital, immediate, and often astonishing.\n","id":18,"length":623,"title":"Reading an Archive of Everyday Life","type":"essay","url":"/symposium/essay-stanley/"},{"content":"Finding Gender in Japanese Literati Painting Where do we locate gender within a work of art? Is it in the subject matter, the maker, the viewer, the larger cultural milieu of production and reception, or is it a combination of these factors? Should the identity of the artist relate to our reception of their work? The objects exhibited in Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection provide varied answers to these questions. In woodblock prints, women are often the subject of the image and the male gaze; in ceramics, women were makers but limited in the tools they could use, resulting in different and often innovative forms; and in the realm of bunjinga (literally, literati painting), women artists enjoyed greater equality and access than they did in other artistic pursuits.\nAlthough there were women artists working in a variety of media, historically, the majority were active in bunjinga, an art form that emerged in Japan in the early eighteenth century. Owing to the fact that eccentrics were tolerated, welcomed, and appreciated in bunjinga circles more so than elsewhere in the art world, some women found their niche in the literati community of painters. The term bunjinga is used interchangeably with nanga (southern painting) in reference to the Southern School of Chinese literati painting in which bunjinga had its roots. Bunjinga in Japan included expanded styles and subject matter and is typically characterized by ink and brushwork on paper or silk, representing subjects such as landscapes, scholarly gatherings, or plant life.\nThe bunjinga painter Noguchi Shōhin (野口小蘋 1847–1917) was born in Osaka and is often described as a child prodigy, studying poetry and painting from a young age. Her father nurtured her interests but passed away when she was just sixteen, leaving Shōhin to support her mother by selling paintings while the family lived in Nagoya.1 She trained in the studio of the well-known male landscape painter Hine Taizan (日根対山 1813–1869), became a professor of painting at the Peers’ Girls School, a women’s university, in 1889, and was eventually appointed an official artist for the imperial family. Efforts toward gender equality in the Meiji period (1868–1912) meant that she widely exhibited and that her talent was recognized in her lifetime, but her experiences were uncommon for women in the nineteenth century.\nWhile we do know that Shōhin emphasized her femininity in her professional image, we do not know if she would have wanted to be called a woman artist. Qualifiers of identity can recognize disparities in advantage and provide points of connection, but they can also perpetuate difference. Although Meiji women were afforded greater social mobility and educational opportunities than their predecessors, they were still limited in their professional options, meaning Shōhin’s success was unusual. As a result, today we may find in her biography a narrative of triumph and resilience or a fascinating story of success against all odds. Yet a gendered approach is not typically applied to Shōhin’s famed male contemporary Tomioka Tessai (富岡鉄斎 1836–1924), who trained under the nun Ōtagaku Rengetsu (太田垣蓮月 1791–1875). The masculinity of Tessai as an artist, the specificity of the male artistic experience, or markers of gender in men’s paintings are left as unexamined topics, as is the impact on his work vis-a-vis his training by a woman. Rather, the study of gendered artistic identity remains one-sided.\nUltimately, when considering gender in the context of art and artists, we are left with these essential questions: Where does the value of art lie, and what responsibilities do gatekeepers such as curators, academics, gallerists, and collectors have to change the parameters of how we understand artworks by women? Her Brush is specifically about Japanese women artists, celebrating their talent and perseverance and pushing the field to consider new approaches to gender in Japanese art, yet if an exhibition of all women’s works were presented without the qualifier in the title, how would our perceptions change? Would the show be more or less popular without the term woman in the title?\nThe canon of art history is constantly rewritten, and the value of art is endlessly shifting. Gender as a lens for understanding visual culture is a relatively recent approach in the history of art as a field, and Her Brush owes its very existence to this shift. As gender theory focuses less on the male/female binary, we must grapple with what turn the field will take next and what new visual connections and values lie ahead.\n  Patricia Fister, Japanese Woman Artists (Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, 1988), 165. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":19,"length":756,"title":"Finding Gender in Japanese Literati Painting","type":"essay","url":"/symposium/essay-miller/"},{"content":"Her Brush, Her Needle: Rethinking the Relationship Between Art and Artisanal Work by Women in Early Modern Japan The exhibition Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection focuses, commonsensically, on works identified as art, predominantly by Japanese women, most of whom were identified in their lifetimes as artists. Acknowledging the obvious—that the terms “art” and “artist” are modern, necessarily convenient, and in the English language—I would nonetheless like to reconsider what types of work might fall under the rubric of “art” and what types of people we might call “artists,” particularly in early modern Japan (c. 1590–1868).\nI am not an art historian but a cultural historian who dabbles in visual sources. This background gives me some license (at least in my own mind) to explore the somewhat arbitrary but nonetheless pervasive boundary between art and artisanal work by women in the early modern period. I propose that querying this boundary gives us insight into how and why artisanal work by women was ubiquitous, while women artists were relatively few. If we look to the types of art represented in Her Brush—painting, calligraphy, ceramics—we can note that elite women of the upper levels of the samurai class and of the nobility received instruction in the literary arts, including calligraphy, as a matter of course. With the growth of educational opportunities for commoners beginning in the late seventeenth century, women’s literacy and numeracy overall increased significantly over the course of the early modern period. Many of the instructional manuals for women that proliferated from the late seventeenth century on focused not only on literacy and literature but on calligraphy and formal letter-writing as well. In short, the calligraphic arts were well established among elite women from the beginning of the early modern period and spread to the commoner classes gradually over time. However, painting and ceramics remained more specialized pursuits.\nBut there were other forms of what we might call artistic or artisanal practice that were widely accessible and were, in fact, deemed necessary for women of all classes. From an early age, women were taught certain productive and creative skills because they were required of a capable homemaker. Sewing, spinning, and weaving were foremost among them, and even women of the elite classes were expected to master these skills, though in practice they might rely on servants to do such work for them. This was because needlework was not just work; its mastery constituted a core virtue for women. Popular instructional manuals for women often invoked the divine origins of needlework, passed down as it was from the Needle Princess (hari hime) during the age of the gods. “There is no greater skill for women than sewing,” states the Treasure Chest of the Greater Learning for Women (Onna daigaku takarabako, c. 1716), for it was not simply productive, it was edifying, and its proper practice would “set [a woman’s] heart right.” Indeed, one could argue that the needle rivaled and perhaps superseded the brush in terms of its importance in fundamentally shaping as well as expressing a woman’s character.\nWomen also took charge of raising silkworms and spinning silk thread, formulating dyes and dyeing fabrics, and making paper and paper goods. They engaged in a host of small craft manufactures, crafting fans, umbrellas and parasols, rosaries (juzu), and decorative twisted cord (mizuhiki); braiding rope; and creating and sharpening needles. This artisanal work was often done in households, sometimes jointly with men. In rural areas, it was done in the off-season and during downtime from agricultural work.\nThese artisanal practices required diligence and manual dexterity, but equally importantly, they demanded a well-honed aesthetic sensibility: an eye for proportion, balance, and symmetry, a measuring gaze that could appreciate symmetrical stitches or an even weave, and a discerning appreciation of pattern and color. Like the barrel makers in Michael Baxandall’s classic book Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy,1 whose calculating eyes instinctively visualized volume and allowed them to keenly appreciate the material worlds depicted in Renaissance painting, Japanese women artisans learned not only how to look at things but how to perceive what was essential in those things in order to make them into something beautiful, something more than an assemblage of constituent parts. Illustrations in instructional manuals show how this sensibility was integral to craft itself: in a section on dyeing fabric in Kyō hyakunin isshu wabunkō (an instructional Hundred Poems for a Hundred Poets from the Japanese Archive, 1829), an illustration shows two women looking at a printed depiction, on paper, of a completed kimono. One of the women is pointing her finger at the print, indicating, it seems, the color or pattern she seeks to replicate through the dyeing process described in the text itself. This, she seems to say, is how it should be—she has absorbed the information, she possesses the skills and materials, she has made her choice, she envisions the outcome. But is she an artist? And is the kimono she will sew out of the fabric she will dye (and perhaps even wove herself) become a work of art? To push the question further, as craft production became more specialized and refined, when did, for example, a fine patterned silk brocade cease to be a useful commodity and become a piece of art with intrinsic aesthetic value? And who got the credit for that product—the woman artisan who wove it or the male shop owner (perhaps her father or husband) who displayed, marketed, and sold it to discerning customers?\n  Michael Baxandall, Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy (Oxford, UK: Clarendon Press, 1972). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":20,"length":929,"title":"Her Brush, Her Needle: Rethinking the Relationship Between Art and Artisanal Work by Women in Early Modern Japan","type":"essay","url":"/symposium/essay-yonemoto/"},{"content":"Ōtagaki Rengetsu’s Buddhist Poetics: Gender and Materiality Poet, painter, and ceramicist Ōtagaki Rengetsu (1791–1875) and her artwork and status as a Jōdo Buddhist nun challenge assumptions concerning the gender identities of historical subjects. Active for over fifty years as an artist after taking Buddhist vows, Rengetsu, and other nun artists of her era, demands a nuanced approach to gender beyond static notions of “female” and “male.” Since she removed physical markers of conventional lay femininity—shaving her head, donning simple robes, taking the name Rengetsu (Lotus Moon)—her identity can be understood through a contextualized lens that accommodates the historically contingent nature of gender categories. Although aspects of her artistic identity and self-expression may seem straightforward, Rengetsu’s work often demonstrates an engagement with a Buddhist philosophical tradition that questions the very nature of the self and artistic subjectivity.\nClose readings of certain works by Rengetsu suggest that she composed her poetry by engaging in an intertextual relationship with past poets that brings these issues of gender and Buddhism to the surface. In particular, Rengetsu looked to the monk-poet Saigyō (1118–1190) and the poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), who himself used Saigyō as a model. An allusion to Saigyō’s verse can even be read into Rengetsu’s most famous poem, represented in the exhibition Her Brush by an elegant poem-picture hanging scroll (fig. 1). Similarly, the role and rhetoric of travel in the work of male predecessors is crucial to Rengetsu’s poetry and warrants an examination of her travel journal to Arashiyama, in the exhibition (fig. 2), along these lines. Even beyond poetic allusion and approach, Rengetsu seems to have modelled her poetic persona on these past poets, suggesting among other things a self-fashioning of identity through literary lineage unbound by gender, as least in the poetic imagination.1\nWhile Rengetsu’s status as a Buddhist nun differentiated her from lay women and impacted her ability to posit herself rhetorically as Saigyō or Bashō reborn, how did it shape her notion of poetics? Do Rengetsu’s works demonstrate, for example, the influence of a Buddhist aesthetic, which would foreground issues of the nonself or the interrogation of phenomenal form? Rengetsu’s ceramics, such as the sake decanter in the exhibition (fig. 3), would seem to project the opposite in their tangible, earthy materiality. And yet Rengetsu’s inscriptive practices on certain three-dimensional objects can result in work that projects an air of the insubstantial. Rengetsu’s work is ripe for analysis regarding the connection between its haptic qualities and Buddhist materiality. Her incorporation of past poetic personae and Buddhist aesthetics raises interesting questions about the intertextuality and material properties of her artifactual poetics.\n  In addition to Saigyō and Bashō, Rengetsu had nun predecessors to emulate, such as Tagami Kikusha (1753–1826), who studied haikai with a teacher in the Bashō lineage and who famously reenacted, in an inverse manner, the journey that Bashō documented in his Narrow Road to the North (Oku no hosomichi, 1702).

This brief overview of my personal journey recounts some of the obstacles and opportunities I have encountered and considers how they shaped my research approach and philosophy. Imperial convents contain a treasure trove of objects and documents, but like some other institutions and private collections in Japan, they have been reluctant to open their doors to scholars.\nWhen I began in this field, very little was published on Japanese women artists, much less nun-artists, so the first step was gathering source materials. With permission, I photographed the objects and documents I was shown in convents and slowly created a private database. Because most of the convent collections are not cataloged, it has been exciting for me to view them in their “original homes.” Studying collections in situ is completely different from studying objects stored in museums or published in books. I have also had the rare opportunity to observe not only how objects are used but also the nuns’ attitudes toward them. For example, most present-day abbesses are adamant that Buddhist paintings and sculptures should not be referred to as art but rather be considered as religious objects, leading me to rethink the question of what constitutes art. I now look at objects from a slightly different perspective than I was taught in university art history courses, and I pay more attention to the vocabulary I use when writing about them.\nAs I surveyed convent collections, I was constantly astounded at the diversity of objects made by imperial nuns, who grew up with culture and art as a vital part of their lives. Among them are chinsō (sculpted and painted portraits of Zen masters), paintings of Buddhist deities and secular subjects, calligraphy, embroidery, and other unique items. Some nuns left writings giving some information about their lives, religious aspirations, and artistic practices. I feel strongly that one needs to build a foundation of works as well as documents to ponder and analyze before drawing any meaningful conclusions.\nI am particularly interested in nuns’ intentions and the role or function of creating in their lives. At what point in their religious careers did they begin to make things, for what purpose, and for whom were these objects created? What Buddhist doctrines or spiritual goals were the nuns seeking to express? Why did they choose specific models? I believe that the words of the Lotus Sutra were integral, for it taught that producing and dedicating art was a way of attaining the Buddha way. Consequently, nuns were inspired to take up a brush, or clay, or even powdered incense to create devotional imagery. The scarcity of biographical information for some of the abbesses of major convents made me realize all the more that the tangible objects they themselves created represent an important part of their legacy.\nIn the course of my research, I discovered one Kyoto convent that had been “forgotten.” I have also tangled with an important thirteenth-century nun, Mugai Nyodai (無外如大), whose identity has become terribly confused: over the centuries her biography was merged with those of two other women. Both the “resurrection” of Zuiryūji (瑞龍寺) convent as well as an ongoing project to restore Mugai Nyodai’s true identity merit further discussion.\nWhile conducting this research in convent collections, the urgent need for conservation and preservation, too, became evident to me. In fact, in my mind now, it goes hand-in-hand with research. In other words, it is crucial not just to publish the results of one’s studies but to give back as well. As an example, I aided one temple in getting four important portrait sculptures of nuns restored. In turn, fascinating discoveries were made during that conservation process.\nFinally, let us briefly consider the role of gender—one of the themes of the Denver exhibition and symposium— in monastic art. I am often asked to define what aspects distinguished the devotional practices and objects made by nuns from those of male clerics. I usually respond by first pointing out the prevalence of Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy, imagery among nun-artists. Needlework, traditionally considered a pastime for women, was also common in Japan’s imperial convents, where nuns often sewed their own robes and surplices. The nun Bunchi (文智 1619–1697) created some unique devotional objects by embroidering phrases from Buddhist texts onto silk and mounted them on small plaques. Other nuns used hair to make devotional objects. Arguments have been made that the combination of fragments of women’s bodies (hair) with a womanly skill (embroidery) represents a gendered form of religious practice not found among their male monastic counterparts.\nResearch focused on Buddhist nuns and convents is growing, not so much in art history but in other fields such as history, literature, and religious studies. All are necessary for us to form a comprehensive picture. The arts of Japanese Buddhist nuns deserve to be more well known than they are, and the Denver exhibition and symposium provide welcome opportunities to introduce a selected body of work to the general public.\n","id":22,"length":862,"title":"Shining Light on Art by Japanese Buddhist Nuns","type":"essay","url":"/symposium/essay-fister/"},{"content":"","id":23,"length":"","title":"Essay by Paul Berry (TK)","type":"","url":""},{"content":"Why is it that people are fascinated by the idea of nuns creating art? Is it because they expect nuns to express something different from “ordinary” artists, perhaps something spiritual? It was not unusual for Buddhist nuns in Japan to write poetry (waka, kanshi), names of sacred deities (myōgō), or single-character/single-line Zen maxims and to paint devotional images as well as secular subjects. Less common was the creation of sculpture or ceramics, but examples do exist.\nThis essay will explore what it meant for nuns in Japan to take up the brush or mold forms from clay. Motivations vary according to their background, religious sect and training, and personalities, just as women took the tonsure for diverse reasons. Some were “placed” in convents when they were young children, but those included in this exhibition all became ordained by their own free will. Some of them renounced worldly life out of pure religious commitment and became heads of temples, while others were only loosely affiliated with religious institutions, choosing not to cut secular ties completely in order to more freely pursue their literary and artistic interests. The Fong-Johnstone collection includes works by nuns affiliated with various Buddhist sects, ranging in date from the seventeenth to the late twentieth century, which provides an opportunity to study a representative sampling of their artistry. Some nuns were quite prolific, and their works can be readily found on the art market. Others were more pious and private in their endeavors, with the result that their works rarely went beyond the walls of their convents or related temples.\nExemplars of Austerity and Discipline: The Zen Nuns Bunchi and Ryōnen Although separated in age by twenty-seven years, the lives of Daitsū Bunchi (1619–1697) and Ryōnen Gensō (1646–1711) overlap in several respects. Both were connected with the aristocratic Konoe family (a branch of the Fujiwara clan)1 and spent their early lives in the imperial palace, although their positions were quite different: Bunchi was the daughter of an emperor, and Ryōnen was the daughter of a lady-in-waiting to an imperial consort. Following social custom, both women entered arranged marriages in their teens. However, they left their husbands, took the tonsure, and committed themselves to rigorous Buddhist practice, studying with reputable Zen masters. Both eventually moved away from Kyoto and established temples elsewhere (Bunchi in Nara, Ryōnen in Edo [now Tokyo]). In the course of their practice and determination to abandon attachments to their female bodies, they engaged in harsh ascetic acts, which I will describe below.\nBunchi’s life has been written about extensively in English, so I will give only a brief account here.2 She was the first daughter of Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596–1680; ruled 1611–1629), and after a brief arranged marriage to her cousin at age thirteen, Bunchi (her childhood name was Ume no Miya) returned to the palace. Inspired by dharma talks by the Rinzai Zen priest Isshi Bunshu (1608–1646), she entreated her emperor father to allow her to take vows and become Isshi’s pupil. She was tonsured at the age of twenty-two, two years after her mother’s death (1640), and made the momentous decision to move out of the palace and take up residence in a small temple called Enshōji (Temple of Infinite Light) in northeastern Kyoto, where she spent the next fifteen years immersed in Zen studies and practice. She met with Priest Isshi occasionally, communicating with him primarily by letters until his death in 1646. Ten years later, Bunchi decided to move to Nara and set up a convent there, inspired in part by a dream in which she was told that she would find solace if she lived in the vicinity of the Ise, Hachiman, and Kasuga shrines.3 An uncle and a fellow disciple of Isshi assisted her with finding land, and in the 1660s, she established a convent called Enshōji south of the old capital of Nara, using the same name as her temple in Kyoto. The “new” Enshōji evolved into a strict training center for women, mostly from aristocratic families, and at one time she presided over a community of twenty nuns. The convent still exists today.\nThe Fong-Johnstone collection includes a single-line calligraphy by Bunchi (fig. 1), written in semi-cursive script, that reads “Jihi Mangyō Bosatsu” (literally, “Bodhisattva of Myriad Acts of Benevolence/Compassion”), which is a name for Kasuga Myōjin,4 long regarded as a spiritual protector of Buddhism in Nara and therefore referred to as a bodhisattva.5 While today we tend to think of Buddhism and Shinto as separate religions because of the forced separation of the two by the Meiji government in the late nineteenth century, in traditional Japan they were inextricably melded together. The written characters of a deity’s name are regarded as sacred; writing the name in this way—as a single line of calligraphy, a form known as myōgō—serves as a kind of invocation.6 The scroll is not signed, but the inscription on the accompanying box records that is by the hand of Abbess Bunchi.\nBunchi ascribed the successful founding of her convent and teaching activities to the good will of Kasuga Myōjin, and she made daily offerings and prayers and encouraged her pupils to follow this practice.7 Her written vow (ganmon) to the Kasuga deity and a poem titled “Kasuga Shrine” are preserved at Enshōji, along with a small wooden Kasuga shrine constructed by her, complete with an avatar deer bearing an inscribed date of 1655, the year that she moved to Nara.8\nThe Buddhism that Bunchi taught at Enshōji was grounded in Rinzai Zen and tempered with elements from Shingon and Ritsu. Her own personal practice was marked by ascetic acts as she struggled to rid herself of worldly attachments and transcend gender. Once she wrote the words of a sutra on a piece of skin peeled or cut off from her hand,9 and on other occasions she poured oil into her palm and lit it while chanting sutras, perhaps as part of an ordination practice. Such extreme acts are not unknown in Buddhism.10 Scholar Barbara Ruch has researched examples of self-mutilation carried out by religious women in Japan, who may have been striving to overcome human desires and render themselves genderless.11 Bunchi’s half-brother Shinkei (1649–1706), prince-abbot of Ichijōin temple in Nara, painted and inscribed a portrait of her in the year following her death. The painting powerfully conveys her fortitude and dedication to the Buddhist dharma (fig. 2). He did not attempt to idealize her but shows her wearing a simple bast-fiber black robe and brown kesa vestment draped over her left shoulder. Shinkei sums up her lifelong practice in one of the lines of the poem: “She trampled the great earth to dust and smashed the great void to oblivion.”12\nIn addition to calligraphy, Bunchi created paintings of important Buddhist figures (Daruma, Kannon), clay portrait sculptures, and small plaques with embroidered characters. She also made some unique myōgō using her emperor father’s fingernail clippings.13 Most of her works are religious in nature and done mainly for herself and the people or temples with which she was intimately connected. Nearly all remain at her convent, Enshōji, or are in other temple collections; the Fong-Johnstone scroll is a rare example that traveled outside Japan.\nThe burgeoning interest in Zen practice among Kyoto’s imperial family and court nobility may have sparked a similar interest in Bunchi’s younger contemporary, Ryōnen Gensō. Ryōnen’s mother was an attendant to Empress Tōfukumon’in (1607–1678), the daughter of Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada who married Emperor Gomizuno-o the year after Bunchi was born.14 As a youth, Ryōnen served Tōfukumon’in’s granddaughter Yoshi no Kimi, but by this time, Bunchi had already left the palace and was living at Enshōji in northeastern Kyoto. Emperor Gomizuno-o and Tōfukumon’in were both fervent pupils of Zen, and by 1650, the emperor was becoming a major patron of the newly introduced (from China) Rinzai Zen school that became known as Ōbaku. There was a kind of “Ōbaku boom,” and Ōbaku Zen temples were rapidly established throughout Japan. Ryōnen’s two brothers became Ōbaku priests, but at the age of seventeen, she was married to a Confucian scholar-doctor.15 Ten years later, she left her family and entered the Rinzai Zen imperial convent Hōkyōji, where she was tonsured by one of Emperor Gomizuno-o’s daughters, Richū (1641–1689).16\nIt is unclear how long Ryōnen resided at Hōkyōji, but she left to go to Edo (presumably with some sort of introduction), aspiring to study under Tetsugyu Dōki, disciple of the emigrant Chinese priest Mu’an (in Japanese, Mokuan). However, she was refused by him on the basis that her beauty would be a distraction to the monks in training. Ryōnen then went to see another disciple of Mu’an, Hakuō Dōtai, at the temple Daikyūan. She was again turned away, and since her beauty was an “obstruction,” she pressed a hot iron to her face to show her commitment and willingness to destroy her femininity in order to devote herself to Zen practice. Ryōnen was not the first woman to disfigure herself in this manner, as there are stories of earlier Japanese female clerics who similarly scarred their faces.17 To mark this act of religious determination, she composed the following two poems (a quatrain in Chinese and waka verse in Japanese) and presented them to Priest Hakuō. The second verse is the one that appears in the scroll in this exhibition (fig. 3).\n Long ago I played games at court where we burned orchid incense;\nnow to enter the Zen path I burn the flesh of my face.\nThe four seasons flow naturally one season to another.\nI don’t know who it is now in the midst of this change.\nIn this living world,\nmy flesh is burned and thrown away.\nI would be wretched\nif I did not think of it as kindling that burns away my sins.18\n Impressed by her fervor, Hakuō accepted her as a disciple, and she trained under him for several years before he designated her as his dharma heir in 1680. Ryōnen later established her own temple, and the priest who had initially refused her, Tetsugyū, presided at the dedication of her Nyoirin Kannon Hall in 1694. Since the poem in the Fong-Johnstone collection is signed “Taiunji Ryōnen,” it must date from after her temple was officially designated as the Ōbaku Zen temple Taiunji in 1701.19 Ryōnen became famous for the radical act of scarring her face that inspired these poems, and the existence of numerous scrolls by her hand suggests that she received many requests for her potent verses.20 Like Bunchi, Ryōnen studied poetry and calligraphy from her childhood, and her manner of writing reflects the style prevailing at the court.\n       Expand          Expand   Ryōnen’s two verses, accompanied by illustrations of her burning her face (fig. 4), appeared in numerous woodblock-printed books and gazetteers, as well as ukiyo-e featuring famous women, such as the print by Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III) (fig. 5). She first became known in the West through Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote a paper titled “The Nun Ryōnen: Fragments of a Japanese Biography,” which was read at the meeting of the Japan Society of London on April 13, 1904.21 Famous for his books on Japan recounting legends and ghost stories, he presented a fictionalized account of Ryōnen’s life, emphasizing her spirit of self-sacrifice.\nFree-Spirited Poet Nuns: Kikusha and Rengetsu Unlike the two nuns discussed above, Tagami Kikusha (1753–1826) and Ōtagaki Rengetsu (1791–1875) did not seek out rigorous religious instruction, nor did they strive to become leaders of temples. Rather, they took Pure Land Buddhist vows after being widowed, which was an accepted way to step away from family and social obligations. Their status as “nuns” gave them the freedom to move around as individuals; both women associated with other poets and painters and devoted themselves to composing poetry and creating art. Kikusha became renowned for her haikai and Rengetsu her waka. Both were incredibly prolific, and the vast numbers of extant works attest to their popularity during their lifetimes. They have both been the subject of numerous books and exhibitions,22 and the growing number of English publications is spurring on their global recognition as poets.23 Moreover, organizations and websites have been established to make their poetry available to a wide audience.24\nBorn in the small village of Tasuki in the province of Nagato (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture),25 Kikusha began to seriously study and compose haikai after her husband’s untimely death (she became a widow at the age of twenty-four). Childless, she returned to her parent’s home and adopted the name Kikusha (1778). At the age of twenty-nine (1781), after taking the tonsure at the Shin sect Buddhist temple Seikōji in Hagi (Yamaguchi prefecture), she embarked on the first of what became a lifelong series of journeys throughout Japan. Kikusha had an unquenchable curiosity about the world and a burning desire to meet and interact with other cultural figures and poets. Similar to the famous poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), for whom traveling was a kind of spiritual pursuit, her journeys provided opportunities for self-discovery and refining her literary skills, and she is sometimes referred to as a “Female Bashō.” Kikusha traveled all over Japan’s main island of Honshu as well as Kyushu; along the way she spent three years in Edo.\nIn addition to composing haikai, Kikusha mastered the fundamentals of ink painting and would frequently record her impressions in simple poem-paintings. She also became interested in Chinese literati culture and, befriending Japanese Confucian scholars and Ōbaku Zen priests, she learned how to compose Chinese poetry (kanshi) and to play the Chinese zither (in Japanese, shichigenkin). Kikusha did numerous paintings of herself with cropped hair typical of lay nuns, seated in front of her zither.26 She inscribed the self-portrait in the exhibition (fig. 6) with six Chinese characters meaning “Satiated with Nature,” followed by the haikai poem below:\n Moon and flowers\nfill this world—\nI beat my barrel belly.27\n Although she probably received some basic instruction, Kikusha could be described as an amateur painter. Her paintings—always accompanied by poems—comprise a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, flowers and plants, figures, and animals. She was content with creating abbreviated, almost sketch-like works, which suited the brevity of haikai, and her paintings display the same carefree brushwork typical of other Edo period haikai poets. Kikusha’s fame led to many requests for her poem-paintings, which served as a source of her livelihood. The sale of her work is documented in letters from Kikusha to the priest of Senjūji temple in her hometown, who acted as an intermediary, fielding requests and handling transactions.\nKikusha kept diaries recording the places she visited, the people she met, and her own poems as well as the verses of others. Because of these travel records, we have a reasonably accurate outline of her life and the people she met. Her adventurous spirit, boundless energy, and insatiable desire to capture her impressions of the world with brush and ink were extraordinary for a woman of her day. As is true of many of the nuns included here, Kikusha expressed her strong will in her bold and dynamic brushwork.\nRengetsu was born into an entirely different world than Kikusha; instead of the countryside, she grew up in the old cultural capital of Kyoto. The origins of her birth parents are unclear, but she was adopted by the Ōtagaki family, whose head came to hold a high-ranking administrative post at the Pure Land Buddhist temple Chion’in in Kyoto.28 In her youth, she worked as a lady-in-waiting in the women’s quarters at Kameoka Castle in the outskirts of Kyoto.29 It was there that Rengetsu (her childhood name was Nobu) learned the classical waka poetry and calligraphy that became the foundation for her livelihood.\nRengetsu was married at the age of seventeen and bore three children, all of whom died. After separating from her husband, she remarried and had another child, but lost both her second husband and daughter to illness. At the age of thirty-three, she took the tonsure, adopting Rengetsu (literally, “lotus moon”) as her Buddhist name. She took up residence in a subtemple at Chion’in with her adoptive father (who also took vows), and they lived together until his death. Rengetsu then moved to the Okazaki district in eastern Kyoto, where many poets and artists lived. She studied waka with Kagawa Kageki and Mutobe Yoshika and within a few years had established a reputation as a poet. Her name was also included in such compendiums as the Heian jinbutsu shi (Record of Heian [Kyoto] Notables),30 and two volumes of her waka were published during her lifetime.31 Waka had been the prevailing form of literary expression for aristocratic women from ancient times, and by the Edo period (1615–1868) women from all walks of life were becoming literate and interested in composing poetry. Rengetsu and Kikusha had the advantage over counterparts from earlier periods of growing up in an age when many famous waka and haikai poets readily accepted and encouraged female pupils.\nLike Kikusha, in addition to writing out her poems, Rengetsu also created poem-paintings, combining her waka with simply brushed seasonal motifs such as a branch of cherry or plum blossoms, the moon (fig. 7), eggplants (fig. 8), birds, butterflies (fig. 9), and occasionally animals. The subject matter is not so different from that of Kikusha, but their brush styles are at opposite poles: Kikusha’s coarse and dynamic, Rengetsu’s delicate and ethereal. Living in Kyoto, Rengetsu was no doubt influenced by the lyrical Maruyama-Shijō tradition of painting, which emphasized nature subjects modeled with soft ink and color washes. She associated with many painters and sometimes inscribed her poems on their paintings. Examples of “joint creations” (gassaku) in the exhibition include those done with Tomioka Tessai (1836–1924) and Wada Gesshin (1800–1870) (figs. 10 and 11). Rengetsu’s unique calligraphic style, featuring elegantly brushed, threadlike lines, is easily identifiable and, judging from the scores of extant works, was highly admired and sought after. She herself loved to write, as expressed in the following verse:\n Taking up the brush\njust for the joy of it,\nwriting on and on, leaving behind\nlong lines of dancing letters.32\n Midpoint in her career, Rengetsu began creating simple ceramic wares on which she either inscribed (with a brush) or incised (with a sharp tool) her poems. She was not the first to write verses on pottery. Half a century earlier, Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743) was producing a wide range of ceramic wares in Kyoto, including some inscribed with Chinese poems, and the literarti (bunjin) artist Aoki Mokubei (1767–1833) also occasionally inscribed verses on his pottery. Rengetsu crafted most of her vessels by hand rather than by using a wheel and had them fired at kilns in eastern Kyoto. She also cooperated with professional potters, who created the wares and then either had Rengetsu add her waka or inscribed the verses themselves.33 For example, the inscription on the box for two tea bowls (fig. 12) records that it is by the potter Kuroda Kōryō (1823–1895), who added Rengetsu’s waka. “Rengetsu ware,” with its sublime synthesis of poetry, calligraphy, and pottery, proved immensely popular, which led to imitations, making connoisseurship of her pottery a very thorny issue.34 Excavations reveal that her wares were used by people from all walks of life and were even purchased as a kind of Kyoto “souvenir” and taken to Edo.35\nThe range of Rengetsu’s ceramics is well represented in the exhibition: sencha teaware, sake vessels, small plates, incense jars, and flower vases. The lotus leaf figures prominently in Rengetsu’s work; it was certainly appropriate because of its symbolism in Buddhism and connection to her name.36 The success of her pottery was linked to her eminence as a poet and her exquisite calligraphy, which gave owners the added pleasure of savoring her waka as well as the drink or food served in the vessels. Sayumi Takahashi has done some interesting research regarding the relationship between the content of Rengetsu’s waka and the containers on which the words are written.37\nSome scholars believe that her mature calligraphy style, displaying slender lines with only subtle variations in thickness, was influenced by the incising of her poems into pottery. For example, Rengetsu often chose to use kana script instead of Chinese characters because the simpler syllabary characters were easier to incise and created less excess clay that had to be cleaned away. In order to make her poems easier to incise (and read), she wrote kana forms individually, leaving generous amounts of space around the lines; it is rare to find her linking more than two or three characters together.\nWhereas Kikusha moved around Japan as she wished, Rengetsu reportedly changed her residence in Kyoto dozens of times to escape from people seeking to meet her and acquire her work. The fact that she was a Buddhist nun added to her celebrity status. Like Kikusha, she was not a full-fledged nun, but the verses of both female poets often embody Buddhist teachings.\n Yoshi-ashi ni On a reed38\nwatari yukuyo ya traversing this transient world,\nmuichimotsu not one single thing.

(Rengetsu)39\n  Perfectly aware,\nnot a thought,\njust the moon\npiercing me with light\nas I gaze upon it. (Rengetsu)40\n Although she took her original vows at a Pure Land temple, Rengetsu associated with clergy from various sects. In her later years, she moved into a small hut on the grounds of Jinkōin temple northwest of Kyoto at the invitation of the chief priest, Wada Gesshin (also known as Gōzan, 1800–1870). It was here that she lived out the remainder of her life. She was such a celebrated figure in Kyoto that numerous artists did portraits of her. The example in the exhibition by Ōhō showing Rengetsu seated in her hut, writing poems on pottery (fig. 13), was probably inspired by Tessai’s famous portrait of the wizened old nun in the collection of Jinkōin.\nUnconventional Nuns and Their Idiosyncratic Calligraphy: Junkyō and Myōdō People are immediately captivated when they see the calligraphy and hear stories about Ōishi Junkyō (1888–1968) and Murase Myōdō (1924–2013). Since both women lived into the modern age, tales of personal encounters with them abound. After taking the tonsure, both women eventually settled into small temples on the outskirts of Kyoto. They took up the brush on a regular basis, leaving a large body of work. Their calligraphic styles are dramatically different, reflecting the life circumstances and personalities of the two nuns, one a dancer turned social worker and the other specializing in vegetarian Buddhist cuisine. Both women authored books that include biographical material as well as discussions of their livelihood, and they were the subjects of television and film documentaries.41\nMy first introduction to Junkyō’s calligraphy was in an art dealer’s shop in Kyoto, where I was shown a tanzaku poem card on which she had written a waka with gold ink. The writing itself was beautiful, but what amazed me most was hearing that she had done it by holding the brush in her mouth, having lost her arms. I then learned the gruesome details of how she had begun a promising career as a geigi dancer in Osaka, but one night, her adoptive father (who was also the proprietor of the teahouse where she lived) came home drunk and, brandishing a sword, killed six of the residents. Junkyō (her childhood name was Yone, geigi name Tsumakichi) survived the attack, but both of her arms were severed. She was seventeen at the time. After recovering from her injuries, she worked for a while in a traveling theatrical group, singing ballads, dancing, and doing comical storytelling. But she found life as a, in her words, “spectacle” unfulfilling, and one day, after watching a canary feed its chicks with its beak, she was inspired to try to write by holding a brush in her mouth. She retired from the stage shortly thereafter and devoted herself to the study of painting and poetry.42 Since she had never gone to school, Junkyō was illiterate, but she now became an avid student of literature.\n       Expand   Junkyō married the calligrapher-painter Yamaguchi Sōhei in 1912 and had two children, but after fifteen years they divorced. She supported herself and her children through painting and calligraphy and set up a counseling service for people with disabilities. While she had often sought spiritual solace at temples, in 1933 (at age forty-five) she officially took the tonsure at Kongobūji on Mt. Kōya, adopting the Buddhist name Junkyō. Three years later she moved into the Shingon temple Kanshūji in Yamashina, east of Kyoto, where she continued to counsel and empower people with disabilities, teaching about Buddhism. In 1947, she founded Bukkōin; she lived out her life at this small temple, and through her activities she served as a model. Not only could she write and paint by holding a brush in her mouth (fig. 14), but she raked her own garden and pulled out weeds with her toes. Her tenacity and independence have inspired others and even led to comparisons with Helen Keller, who actually met Junkyō during one of her trips to Japan.\nI was taken to Bukkōin by the art dealer who initially introduced me to her work and was able to meet her son and daughter-in-law, who showed me various works and photographs and also gave me some books and an unpublished manuscript that included excerpts from Junkyō’s diary. I was also given a newspaper clipping that mentioned an exhibition of her work at a museum in Munich in 1966. Nature subjects prevail in Junkyō’s oeuvre (figs. 15 and 16), but she also depicted the bodhisattva Kannon (fig. 17) and occasionally other figures. She frequently added the Buddhist maxim “Every day is a good day” to her Kannon paintings; this example is signed “Handless Junkyō.” The paintings in the Denver Art Museum exhibition, Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection, are rather simply brushed, but other works by Junkyō are surprisingly detailed and colorful and must have taken her a long time to complete. An example is her lovely rendering of birds and grapes inscribed with the poem about being inspired by the canary quoted above (fig. 18). The simplicity of her writing shares some qualities with Rengetsu’s. In fact, Junkyō was very much aware of Rengetsu’s poetry and calligraphy and reportedly studied her script in her thirties and forties.43 She did paintings of a woman fulling cloth on which she inscribed a waka by Rengetsu, whom she acknowledges in her inscriptions.44 While Junkyō’s calligraphy does not display the hair-fine brushlines of Rengetsu’s, and the rhythmic flow is different, aesthetically the similarities are there, especially because both nuns wrote primarily with the simplified kana script.\nPeople who met Junkyō described her as “radiant,” “humble,” and “peaceful”; these same qualities emanate from her paintings and calligraphy. In a letter to friends shortly before her death, she wrote that she had suffered much bitterness because her arms were cut off but that the incident enabled her to find the path of Buddha and inner peace. Getting to know others in the limb-loss community had been a special part of her life, and she wanted to thank everyone and tell them to keep up their spirits.45\nThe Zen nun Murase Myōdō also shared a similar path; in 1963, at the age of thirty-nine, she was hit by a car while out shopping, leaving her partially paralyzed. She lost the use of her right, dominant arm. She then threw herself wholeheartedly into using her left, preparing vegetarian Buddhist cuisine called shojin ryori, as well as creating bold, dynamic calligraphy.\nBorn into the family of a rice merchant in Aichi prefecture (she was the fifth of nine children), at the age of nine Myōdō entered the Rinzai Zen temple Kōgenji in Kyoto. Her decision was influenced in part by the traditional belief that if one child took the tonsure, other members of the family could be reborn in paradise. At age fourteen, she went to a special school for nuns in Gifu and then continued five more years of training at the Rinzai Zen convent Tenneiji. She returned to Kōgenji in 1943 and did further training at Enkōji convent in Kyoto, then served at two other temples before becoming head of Gesshinji in Ōtsu city, Shiga prefecture in 1975. There Myōdō became famous for her vegetarian cuisine, prepared with the deep mindfulness characteristic of Zen discipline. She claimed that while pouring her heart and soul into preparing food, she always kept foremost in mind the people who would eat it. Her goal was to nurture by providing them with something healthy and delicious.\nAfter the car accident, Myōdō was hospitalized for nine months. She suffered severe pain and found it difficult to breathe, but she remembers being encouraged by a doctor who said, “If the Buddha hadn’t wanted you to live, you’d be dead. The fact that you are alive is because you are needed.”46 Hearing that gave her strength and renewed her sense of purpose in life. She was determined to live every day fully, and cooking and preparing food became her spiritual practice. Having lost the use of her right arm and right leg, she trained herself to use her left hand to hold a writing brush, as well as to chop vegetables and grind sesame seeds with pestle and mortar for what became one of her specialties, sesame tofu. Giving by cooking and providing people with a pleasurable dining experience became her passion.\nRegretfully, I never had the chance to meet Myōdō or enjoy her shōjin ryōri at Gesshinji. I first learned about this remarkable nun through seeing some examples of her boldly brushed calligraphy in a charity exhibition of works by contemporary Zen priests in 1997. Her personality, captured in a photograph for the cover of her 2004 book (fig. 19), was the opposite of Junkyō’s: brash, outspoken, with a wry sense of humor. This is reflected in her brushwork, exemplified in the hanging scroll Breaking Waves in the Pines (shōtō) (fig. 20) and two-sided screen panel comprising the single characters “mu” and “kan” (fig. 21), which together mean “no barrier” (mukan). This refers to the state of an enlightened person who has transcended dualistic views, where everything is one, i.e., there are no barriers between you and the “other.” Myōdō wrote that when she was young, at one point she imagined that she would like to live like Rengetsu, crafting clay pots and composing poetry, but after losing the use of her right arm and leg, she found it impossible. She then persevered, learning how to write calligraphy with her left hand.47 As she became famous for her cuisine, requests for her brushwork no doubt increased. The majority of Myōdō’s extant works are executed with a large brush, which was perhaps easier for her to handle. She once said that calligraphy and cooking are both like “fighting with a real sword” (shinken shōbu). “Facing a white sheet of paper, it is you who makes it [the calligraphy or the food] live or die.”48 Interviews (in Japanese) with Myōdō are easily accessible on YouTube. While she is no longer with us, we can still hear her deliver short sermons on “life” and also sense that vivid life in her brushwork.\nNotes   Bunchi’s grandmother (Emperor Gomizuno-o’s mother) and Ryōnen’s mother were both from the Konoe family. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See Patricia Fister, “Creating Devotional Art with Body Fragments: The Buddhist Nun Bunchi and Her Father, Emperor Gomizuno-o,” Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 27, nos. 3–4 (2000): 213–38; Fister, Art by Buddhist Nuns: Treasures from the Imperial Convents of Japan (New York: Institute for Medieval Japanese Studies, Columbia University, 2003), 22–3; Fister, “Visual Culture in Japan’s Imperial Buddhist Convents: The Making of Devotional Objects as Expressions of Faith and Practice,” in Zen and Material Culture, ed.
