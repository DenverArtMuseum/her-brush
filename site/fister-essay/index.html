          <p>Why is it that people are fascinated by the idea of nuns creating art? Is it because they expect nuns to express something different from âordinaryâ artists, perhaps something spiritual? It was not unusual for Buddhist nuns in Japan to write poetry (<em>waka</em>, <em>kanshi</em>), names of sacred deities (<em>myÅgÅ</em>), or single-character/single-line Zen maxims and to paint devotional images as well as secular subjects. Less common was the creation of sculpture or ceramics, but examples do exist.</p>
<p>This essay will explore what it meant for nuns in Japan to take up the brush or mold forms from clay. Motivations vary according to their background, religious sect and training, and personalities, just as women took the tonsure for diverse reasons. Some were âplacedâ in convents when they were young children, but those included in this exhibition all became ordained by their own free will. Some of them renounced worldly life out of pure religious commitment and became heads of temples, while others were only loosely affiliated with religious institutions, choosing not to cut secular ties completely in order to more freely pursue their literary and artistic interests. The Fong-Johnstone collection includes works by nuns affiliated with various Buddhist sects, ranging in date from the seventeenth to the late twentieth century, which provides an opportunity to study a representative sampling of their artistry. Some nuns were quite prolific, and their works can be readily found on the art market. Others were more pious and private in their endeavors, with the result that their works rarely went beyond the walls of their convents or related temples.</p>
<h2 id="exemplars-of-austerity-and-discipline-the-zen-nuns-bunchi-and-ryÅnen">Exemplars of Austerity and Discipline: The Zen Nuns Bunchi and RyÅnen</h2>
<p>Although separated in age by twenty-seven years, the lives of DaitsÅ« Bunchi (1619â1697) and RyÅnen GensÅ (1646â1711) overlap in several respects. Both were connected with the aristocratic Konoe family (a branch of the Fujiwara clan)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and spent their early lives in the imperial palace, although their positions were quite different: Bunchi was the daughter of an emperor, and RyÅnen was the daughter of a lady-in-waiting to an imperial consort. Following social custom, both women entered arranged marriages in their teens. However, they left their husbands, took the tonsure, and committed themselves to rigorous Buddhist practice, studying with reputable Zen masters. Both eventually moved away from Kyoto and established temples elsewhere (Bunchi in Nara, RyÅnen in Edo [now Tokyo]). In the course of their practice and determination to abandon attachments to their female bodies, they engaged in harsh ascetic acts, which I will describe below.</p>
<p>Bunchiâs life has been written about extensively in English, so I will give only a brief account here.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> She was the first daughter of Emperor Gomizuno-o (1596â1680; ruled 1611â1629), and after a brief arranged marriage to her cousin at age thirteen, Bunchi (her childhood name was Ume no Miya) returned to the palace. Inspired by dharma talks by the Rinzai Zen priest Isshi Bunshu (1608â1646), she entreated her emperor father to allow her to take vows and become Isshiâs pupil. She was tonsured at the age of twenty-two, two years after her motherâs death (1640), and made the momentous decision to move out of the palace and take up residence in a small temple called EnshÅji (Temple of Infinite Light) in northeastern Kyoto, where she spent the next fifteen years immersed in Zen studies and practice. She met with Priest Isshi occasionally, communicating with him primarily by letters until his death in 1646. Ten years later, Bunchi decided to move to Nara and set up a convent there, inspired in part by a dream in which she was told that she would find solace if she lived in the vicinity of the Ise, Hachiman, and Kasuga shrines.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> An uncle and a fellow disciple of Isshi assisted her with finding land, and in the 1660s, she established a convent called EnshÅji south of the old capital of Nara, using the same name as her temple in Kyoto. The ânewâ EnshÅji evolved into a strict training center for women, mostly from aristocratic families, and at one time she presided over a community of twenty nuns. The convent still exists today.</p>
<p>The Fong-Johnstone collection includes a single-line calligraphy by Bunchi (fig. 1), written in semi-cursive script, that reads â<em>Jihi MangyÅ Bosatsuâ</em> (literally, âBodhisattva of Myriad Acts of Benevolence/Compassionâ), which is a name for Kasuga MyÅjin,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> long regarded as a spiritual protector of Buddhism in Nara and therefore referred to as a bodhisattva.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> While today we tend to think of Buddhism and Shinto as separate religions because of the forced separation of the two by the Meiji government in the late nineteenth century, in traditional Japan they were inextricably melded together. The written characters of a deityâs name are regarded as sacred; writing the name in this wayâas a single line of calligraphy, a form known as <em>myÅgÅ</em>âserves as a kind of invocation.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The scroll is not signed, but the inscription on the accompanying box records that is by the hand of Abbess Bunchi.</p>
<p>Bunchi ascribed the successful founding of her convent and teaching activities to the good will of Kasuga MyÅjin, and she made daily offerings and prayers and encouraged her pupils to follow this practice.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Her written vow (<em>ganmon</em>) to the Kasuga deity and a poem titled âKasuga Shrineâ are preserved at EnshÅji, along with a small wooden Kasuga shrine constructed by her, complete with an avatar deer bearing an inscribed date of 1655, the year that she moved to Nara.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddhism that Bunchi taught at EnshÅji was grounded in Rinzai Zen and tempered with elements from Shingon and Ritsu. Her own personal practice was marked by ascetic acts as she struggled to rid herself of worldly attachments and transcend gender. Once she wrote the words of a sutra on a piece of skin peeled or cut off from her hand,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and on other occasions she poured oil into her palm and lit it while chanting sutras, perhaps as part of an ordination practice.

The painting powerfully conveys her fortitude and dedication to the Buddhist dharma (fig. 2). He did not attempt to idealize her but shows her wearing a simple bast-fiber black robe and brown <em>kesa</em> vestment draped over her left shoulder. Shinkei sums up her lifelong practice in one of the lines of the poem: âShe trampled the great earth to dust and smashed the great void to oblivion.â<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to calligraphy, Bunchi created paintings of important Buddhist figures (Daruma, Kannon), clay portrait sculptures, and small plaques with embroidered characters. She also made some unique <em>myÅgÅ</em> using her emperor fatherâs fingernail clippings.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Most of her works are religious in nature and done mainly for herself and the people or temples with which she was intimately connected. Nearly all remain at her convent, EnshÅji, or are in other temple collections; the Fong-Johnstone scroll is a rare example that traveled outside Japan.</p>
<p>The burgeoning interest in Zen practice among Kyotoâs imperial family and court nobility may have sparked a similar interest in Bunchiâs younger contemporary, RyÅnen GensÅ. RyÅnenâs mother was an attendant to Empress TÅfukumonâin (1607â1678), the daughter of Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada who married Emperor Gomizuno-o the year after Bunchi was born.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> As a youth, RyÅnen served TÅfukumonâinâs granddaughter Yoshi no Kimi, but by this time, Bunchi had already left the palace and was living at EnshÅji in northeastern Kyoto. Emperor Gomizuno-o and TÅfukumonâin were both fervent pupils of Zen, and by 1650, the emperor was becoming a major patron of the newly introduced (from China) Rinzai Zen school that became known as <strong>Å</strong>baku. There was a kind of â<strong>Å</strong>baku boom,â and <strong>Å</strong>baku Zen temples were rapidly established throughout Japan. RyÅnenâs two brothers became <strong>Å</strong>baku priests, but at the age of seventeen, she was married to a Confucian scholar-doctor.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Ten years later, she left her family and entered the Rinzai Zen imperial convent HÅkyÅji, where she was tonsured by one of Emperor Gomizuno-oâs daughters, RichÅ« (1641â1689).<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>It is unclear how long RyÅnen resided at HÅkyÅji, but she left to go to Edo (presumably with some sort of introduction), aspiring to study under Tetsugyu DÅki, disciple of the emigrant Chinese priest Muâan (in Japanese, Mokuan). However, she was refused by him on the basis that her beauty would be a distraction to the monks in training. RyÅnen then went to see another disciple of Muâan, HakuÅ DÅtai, at the temple DaikyÅ«an. She was again turned away, and since her beauty was an âobstruction,â she pressed a hot iron to her face to show her commitment and willingness to destroy her femininity in order to devote herself to Zen practice. RyÅnen was not the first woman to disfigure herself in this manner, as there are stories of earlier Japanese female clerics who similarly scarred their faces.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> To mark this act of religious determination, she composed the following two poems (a quatrain in Chinese and waka verse in Japanese) and presented them to Priest HakuÅ. The second verse is the one that appears in the scroll in this exhibition (fig. 3).</p>

<p>Impressed by her fervor, HakuÅ accepted her as a disciple, and she trained under him for several years before he designated her as his dharma heir in 1680. RyÅnen later established her own temple, and the priest who had initially refused her, TetsugyÅ«, presided at the dedication of her Nyoirin Kannon Hall in 1694. Since the poem in the Fong-Johnstone collection is signed âTaiunji RyÅnen,â it must date from after her temple was officially designated as the <strong>Å</strong>baku Zen temple Taiunji in 1701.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> RyÅnen became famous for the radical act of scarring her face that inspired these poems, and the existence of numerous scrolls by her hand suggests that she received many requests for her potent verses.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Like Bunchi, RyÅnen studied poetry and calligraphy from her childhood, and her manner of writing reflects the style prevailing at the court.</p>

<p>RyÅnenâs two verses, accompanied by illustrations of her burning her face (fig. 4), appeared in numerous woodblock-printed books and gazetteers, as well as <em>ukiyo-e</em> featuring famous women, such as the print by Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III) (fig. 5). She first became known in the West through Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote a paper titled âThe Nun RyÅnen: Fragments of a Japanese Biography,â which was read at the meeting of the Japan Society of London on April 13, 1904.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Famous for his books on Japan recounting legends and ghost stories, he presented a fictionalized account of RyÅnenâs life, emphasizing her spirit of self-sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="free-spirited-poet-nuns-kikusha-and-rengetsu">Free-Spirited Poet Nuns: Kikusha and Rengetsu</h2>
<p>Unlike the two nuns discussed above, Tagami Kikusha (1753â1826) and <strong>Å</strong>tagaki Rengetsu (1791â1875) did not seek out rigorous religious instruction, nor did they strive to become leaders of temples. Rather, they took Pure Land Buddhist vows after being widowed, which was an accepted way to step away from family and social obligations. Their status as ânunsâ gave them the freedom to move around as individuals; both women associated with other poets and painters and devoted themselves to composing poetry and creating art. Kikusha became renowned for her <em>haikai</em> and Rengetsu her <em>waka</em>. Both were incredibly prolific, and the vast numbers of extant works attest to their popularity during their lifetimes. They have both been the subject of numerous books and exhibitions,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> and the growing number of English publications is spurring on their global recognition as poets.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Moreover, organizations and websites have been established to make their poetry available to a wide audience.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Born in the small village of Tasuki in the province of Nagato (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture),<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Kikusha began to seriously study and compose <em>haikai</em> after her husbandâs untimely death (she became a widow at the age of twenty-four). Childless, she returned to her parentâs home and adopted the name Kikusha (1778). At the age of twenty-nine (1781), after taking the tonsure at the Shin sect Buddhist temple SeikÅji in Hagi (Yamaguchi prefecture), she embarked on the first of what became a lifelong series of journeys throughout Japan. Kikusha had an unquenchable curiosity about the world and a burning desire to meet and interact with other cultural figures and poets. Similar to the famous poet Matsuo BashÅ (1644â1694), for whom traveling was a kind of spiritual pursuit, her journeys provided opportunities for self-discovery and refining her literary skills, and she is sometimes referred to as a âFemale BashÅ.â Kikusha traveled all over Japanâs main island of Honshu as well as Kyushu; along the way she spent three years in Edo.</p>
<p>In addition to composing <em>haikai</em>, Kikusha mastered the fundamentals of ink painting and would frequently record her impressions in simple poem-paintings. She also became interested in Chinese literati culture and, befriending Japanese Confucian scholars and <strong>Å</strong>baku Zen priests, she learned how to compose Chinese poetry (<em>kanshi</em>) and to play the Chinese zither (in Japanese, <em>shichigenkin</em>). Kikusha did numerous paintings of herself with cropped hair typical of lay nuns, seated in front of her zither.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> She inscribed the self-portrait in the exhibition (fig. 6) with six Chinese characters meaning âSatiated with Nature,â followed by the <em>haikai</em> poem below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moon and flowers<br />
fill this worldâ<br />
I beat my barrel belly.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although she probably received some basic instruction, Kikusha could be described as an amateur painter. Her paintingsâalways accompanied by poemsâcomprise a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, flowers and plants, figures, and animals. She was content with creating abbreviated, almost sketch-like works, which suited the brevity of <em>haikai</em>, and her paintings display the same carefree brushwork typical of other Edo period <em>haikai</em> poets. Kikushaâs fame led to many requests for her poem-paintings, which served as a source of her livelihood. The sale of her work is documented in letters from Kikusha to the priest of SenjÅ«ji temple in her hometown, who acted as an intermediary, fielding requests and handling transactions.</p>
<p>Kikusha kept diaries recording the places she visited, the people she met, and her own poems as well as the verses of others. Because of these travel records, we have a reasonably accurate outline of her life and the people she met. Her adventurous spirit, boundless energy, and insatiable desire to capture her impressions of the world with brush and ink were extraordinary for a woman of her day. As is true of many of the nuns included here, Kikusha expressed her strong will in her bold and dynamic brushwork.</p>
<p>Rengetsu was born into an entirely different world than Kikusha; instead of the countryside, she grew up in the old cultural capital of Kyoto. The origins of her birth parents are unclear, but she was adopted by the <strong>Å</strong>tagaki family, whose head came to hold a high-ranking administrative post at the Pure Land Buddhist temple Chionâin in Kyoto.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> In her youth, she worked as a lady-in-waiting in the womenâs quarters at Kameoka Castle in the outskirts of Kyoto.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> It was there that Rengetsu (her childhood name was Nobu) learned the classical <em>waka</em> poetry and calligraphy that became the foundation for her livelihood.</p>
<p>Rengetsu was married at the age of seventeen and bore three children, all of whom died. After separating from her husband, she remarried and had another child, but lost both her second husband and daughter to illness. At the age of thirty-three, she took the tonsure, adopting Rengetsu (literally, âlotus moonâ) as her Buddhist name. She took up residence in a subtemple at Chionâin with her adoptive father (who also took vows), and they lived together until his death. Rengetsu then moved to the Okazaki district in eastern Kyoto, where many poets and artists lived. She studied <em>waka</em> with Kagawa Kageki and Mutobe Yoshika and within a few years had established a reputation as a poet. Her name was also included in such compendiums as the <em>Heian jinbutsu shi</em> (Record of Heian [Kyoto] Notables),<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> and two volumes of her <em>waka</em> were published during her lifetime.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> <em>Waka</em> had been the prevailing form of literary expression for aristocratic women from ancient times, and by the Edo period (1615â1868) women from all walks of life were becoming literate and interested in composing poetry. Rengetsu and Kikusha had the advantage over counterparts from earlier periods of growing up in an age when many famous <em>waka</em> and <em>haikai</em> poets readily accepted and encouraged female pupils.</p>

<p>Like Kikusha, in addition to writing out her poems, Rengetsu also created poem-paintings, combining her waka with simply brushed seasonal motifs such as a branch of cherry or plum blossoms, the moon (fig. 7), eggplants (fig. 8), birds, butterflies (fig. 9), and occasionally animals. The subject matter is not so different from that of Kikusha, but their brush styles are at opposite poles: Kikushaâs coarse and dynamic, Rengetsuâs delicate and ethereal. Living in Kyoto, Rengetsu was no doubt influenced by the lyrical Maruyama-ShijÅ tradition of painting, which emphasized nature subjects modeled with soft ink and color washes. She associated with many painters and sometimes inscribed her poems on their paintings. Examples of âjoint creationsâ (<em>gassaku</em>) in the exhibition include those done with Tomioka Tessai (1836â1924) and Wada Gesshin (1800â1870) (figs. 10 and 11). Rengetsuâs unique calligraphic style, featuring elegantly brushed, threadlike lines, is easily identifiable and, judging from the scores of extant works, was highly admired and sought after. She herself loved to write, as expressed in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking up the brush<br />
just for the joy of it,<br />
writing on and on, leaving behind<br />
long lines of dancing letters.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Midpoint in her career, Rengetsu began creating simple ceramic wares on which she either inscribed (with a brush) or incised (with a sharp tool) her poems. She was not the first to write verses on pottery. Half a century earlier, Ogata Kenzan (1663â1743) was producing a wide range of ceramic wares in Kyoto, including some inscribed with Chinese poems, and the literarti (<em>bunjin)</em> artist Aoki Mokubei (1767â1833) also occasionally inscribed verses on his pottery. Rengetsu crafted most of her vessels by hand rather than by using a wheel and had them fired at kilns in eastern Kyoto. She also cooperated with professional potters, who created the wares and then either had Rengetsu add her <em>waka</em> or inscribed the verses themselves.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> For example, the inscription on the box for two tea bowls (fig. 12) records that it is by the potter Kuroda KÅryÅ (1823â1895), who added Rengetsuâs <em>waka</em>. âRengetsu ware,â with its sublime synthesis of poetry, calligraphy, and pottery, proved immensely popular, which led to imitations, making connoisseurship of her pottery a very thorny issue.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> Excavations reveal that her wares were used by people from all walks of life and were even purchased as a kind of Kyoto âsouvenirâ and taken to Edo.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The range of Rengetsuâs ceramics is well represented in the exhibition: <em>sencha</em> teaware, sake vessels, small plates, incense jars, and flower vases. The lotus leaf figures prominently in Rengetsuâs work; it was certainly appropriate because of its symbolism in Buddhism and connection to her name.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> The success of her pottery was linked to her eminence as a poet and her exquisite calligraphy, which gave owners the added pleasure of savoring her <em>waka</em> as well as the drink or food served in the vessels. Sayumi Takahashi has done some interesting research regarding the relationship between the content of Rengetsuâs <em>waka</em> and the containers on which the words are written.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Some scholars believe that her mature calligraphy style, displaying slender lines with only subtle variations in thickness, was influenced by the incising of her poems into pottery. For example, Rengetsu often chose to use <em>kana</em> script instead of Chinese characters because the simpler syllabary characters were easier to incise and created less excess clay that had to be cleaned away. In order to make her poems easier to incise (and read), she wrote <em>kana</em> forms individually, leaving generous amounts of space around the lines; it is rare to find her linking more than two or three characters together.</p>
<p>Whereas Kikusha moved around Japan as she wished, Rengetsu reportedly changed her residence in Kyoto dozens of times to escape from people seeking to meet her and acquire her work. The fact that she was a Buddhist nun added to her celebrity status. Like Kikusha, she was not a full-fledged nun, but the verses of both female poets often embody Buddhist teachings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yoshi-ashi ni</em> On a reed<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><br />
<em>watari yukuyo ya</em> traversing this transient world,<br />
<em>muichimotsu</em> not one single thing. (Kikusha)<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clad in black robes,<br />
I should have no attractions to<br />
the shapes and scents of this world;<br />
But how can I keep my vows<br />
gazing at todayâs crimson maple leaves? (Rengetsu)<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectly aware,<br />
not a thought,<br />
just the moon<br />
piercing me with light<br />
as I gaze upon it. (Rengetsu)<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although she took her original vows at a Pure Land temple, Rengetsu associated with clergy from various sects. In her later years, she moved into a small hut on the grounds of JinkÅin temple northwest of Kyoto at the invitation of the chief priest, Wada Gesshin (also known as GÅzan, 1800â1870). It was here that she lived out the remainder of her life. She was such a celebrated figure in Kyoto that numerous artists did portraits of her. The example in the exhibition by <strong>Å</strong>hÅ showing Rengetsu seated in her hut, writing poems on pottery (fig. 13), was probably inspired by Tessaiâs famous portrait of the wizened old nun in the collection of JinkÅin.</p>
<h2 id="unconventional-nuns-and-their-idiosyncratic-calligraphy-junkyÅ-and-myÅdÅ">Unconventional Nuns and Their Idiosyncratic Calligraphy: JunkyÅ and MyÅdÅ</h2>
<p>People are immediately captivated when they see the calligraphy and hear stories about <strong>Å</strong>ishi JunkyÅ (1888â1968) and Murase MyÅdÅ (1924â2013). Since both women lived into the modern age, tales of personal encounters with them abound. After taking the tonsure, both women eventually settled into small temples on the outskirts of Kyoto. They took up the brush on a regular basis, leaving a large body of work. Their calligraphic styles are dramatically different, reflecting the life circumstances and personalities of the two nuns, one a dancer turned social worker and the other specializing in vegetarian Buddhist cuisine. Both women authored books that include biographical material as well as discussions of their livelihood, and they were the subjects of television and film documentaries.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>My first introduction to JunkyÅâs calligraphy was in an art dealerâs shop in Kyoto, where I was shown a <em>tanzaku</em> poem card on which she had written a <em>waka</em> with gold ink. The writing itself was beautiful, but what amazed me most was hearing that she had done it by holding the brush in her mouth, having lost her arms. I then learned the gruesome details of how she had begun a promising career as a <em>geigi</em> dancer in Osaka, but one night, her adoptive father (who was also the proprietor of the teahouse where she lived) came home drunk and, brandishing a sword, killed six of the residents. JunkyÅ (her childhood name was Yone, <em>geigi</em> name Tsumakichi) survived the attack, but both of her arms were severed. She was seventeen at the time. After recovering from her injuries, she worked for a while in a traveling theatrical group, singing ballads, dancing, and doing comical storytelling. But she found life as a, in her words, âspectacleâ unfulfilling, and one day, after watching a canary feed its chicks with its beak, she was inspired to try to write by holding a brush in her mouth. She retired from the stage shortly thereafter and devoted herself to the study of painting and poetry.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> Since she had never gone to school, JunkyÅ was illiterate, but she now became an avid student of literature.</p>

<p>JunkyÅ married the calligrapher-painter Yamaguchi SÅhei in 1912 and had two children, but after fifteen years they divorced. She supported herself and her children through painting and calligraphy and set up a counseling service for people with disabilities. While she had often sought spiritual solace at temples, in 1933 (at age forty-five) she officially took the tonsure at KongobÅ«ji on Mt. KÅya, adopting the Buddhist name JunkyÅ. Three years later she moved into the Shingon temple KanshÅ«ji in Yamashina, east of Kyoto, where she continued to counsel and empower people with disabilities, teaching about Buddhism. In 1947, she founded BukkÅin; she lived out her life at this small temple, and through her activities she served as a model. Not only could she write and paint by holding a brush in her mouth (fig. 14), but she raked her own garden and pulled out weeds with her toes. Her tenacity and independence have inspired others and even led to comparisons with Helen Keller, who actually met JunkyÅ during one of her trips to Japan.</p>
<p>I was taken to BukkÅin by the art dealer who initially introduced me to her work and was able to meet her son and daughter-in-law, who showed me various works and photographs and also gave me some books and an unpublished manuscript that included excerpts from JunkyÅâs diary. I was also given a newspaper clipping that mentioned an exhibition of her work at a museum in Munich in 1966. Nature subjects prevail in JunkyÅâs oeuvre (figs. 15 and 16), but she also depicted the bodhisattva Kannon (fig. 17) and occasionally other figures. She frequently added the Buddhist maxim âEvery day is a good dayâ to her Kannon paintings; this example is signed âHandless JunkyÅ.â The paintings in the Denver Art Museum exhibition, <em>Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection</em>, are rather simply brushed, but other works by JunkyÅ are surprisingly detailed and colorful and must have taken her a long time to complete. An example is her lovely rendering of birds and grapes inscribed with the poem about being inspired by the canary quoted above (fig. 18). The simplicity of her writing shares some qualities with Rengetsuâs. In fact, JunkyÅ was very much aware of Rengetsuâs poetry and calligraphy and reportedly studied her script in her thirties and forties.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> She did paintings of a woman fulling cloth on which she inscribed a <em>waka</em> by Rengetsu, whom she acknowledges in her inscriptions.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> While JunkyÅâs calligraphy does not display the hair-fine brushlines of Rengetsuâs, and the rhythmic flow is different, aesthetically the similarities are there, especially because both nuns wrote primarily with the simplified <em>kana</em> script.</p>
<p>People who met JunkyÅ described her as âradiant,â âhumble,â and âpeacefulâ; these same qualities emanate from her paintings and calligraphy. In a letter to friends shortly before her death, she wrote that she had suffered much bitterness because her arms were cut off but that the incident enabled her to find the path of Buddha and inner peace. Getting to know others in the limb-loss community had been a special part of her life, and she wanted to thank everyone and tell them to keep up their spirits.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>
<p>The Zen nun Murase MyÅdÅ also shared a similar path; in 1963, at the age of thirty-nine, she was hit by a car while out shopping, leaving her partially paralyzed. She lost the use of her right, dominant arm. She then threw herself wholeheartedly into using her left, preparing vegetarian Buddhist cuisine called <em>shojin ryori,</em> as well as creating bold, dynamic calligraphy.</p>
<p>Born into the family of a rice merchant in Aichi prefecture (she was the fifth of nine children), at the age of nine MyÅdÅ entered the Rinzai Zen temple KÅgenji in Kyoto. Her decision was influenced in part by the traditional belief that if one child took the tonsure, other members of the family could be reborn in paradise. At age fourteen, she went to a special school for nuns in Gifu and then continued five more years of training at the Rinzai Zen convent Tenneiji. She returned to KÅgenji in 1943 and did further training at EnkÅji convent in Kyoto, then served at two other temples before becoming head of Gesshinji in <strong>Å</strong>tsu city, Shiga prefecture in 1975. There MyÅdÅ became famous for her vegetarian cuisine, prepared with the deep mindfulness characteristic of Zen discipline. She claimed that while pouring her heart and soul into preparing food, she always kept foremost in mind the people who would eat it. Her goal was to nurture by providing them with something healthy and delicious.</p>
<p>After the car accident, MyÅdÅ was hospitalized for nine months. She suffered severe pain and found it difficult to breathe, but she remembers being encouraged by a doctor who said, âIf the Buddha hadnât wanted you to live, youâd be dead. The fact that you are alive is because you are needed.â<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Hearing that gave her strength and renewed her sense of purpose in life. She was determined to live every day fully, and cooking and preparing food became her spiritual practice. Having lost the use of her right arm and right leg, she trained herself to use her left hand to hold a writing brush, as well as to chop vegetables and grind sesame seeds with pestle and mortar for what became one of her specialties, sesame tofu. Giving by cooking and providing people with a pleasurable dining experience became her passion.</p>
<p>Regretfully, I never had the chance to meet MyÅdÅ or enjoy her <em>shÅjin ryÅri</em> at Gesshinji. I first learned about this remarkable nun through seeing some examples of her boldly brushed calligraphy in a charity exhibition of works by contemporary Zen priests in 1997. Her personality, captured in a photograph for the cover of her 2004 book (fig. 19), was the opposite of JunkyÅâs: brash, outspoken, with a wry sense of humor. This is reflected in her brushwork, exemplified in the hanging scroll <em>Breaking Waves in the Pines (shÅtÅ)</em> (fig. 20) and two-sided screen panel comprising the single characters â<em>mu</em>â and â<em>kan</em>â (fig. 21), which together mean âno barrierâ (<em>mukan</em>). This refers to the state of an enlightened person who has transcended dualistic views, where everything is one, i.e., there are no barriers between you and the âother.â MyÅdÅ wrote that when she was young, at one point she imagined that she would like to live like Rengetsu, crafting clay pots and composing poetry, but after losing the use of her right arm and leg, she found it impossible. She then persevered, learning how to write calligraphy with her left hand.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> As she became famous for her cuisine, requests for her brushwork no doubt increased. The majority of MyÅdÅâs extant works are executed with a large brush, which was perhaps easier for her to handle. She once said that calligraphy and cooking are both like âfighting with a real swordâ (<em>shinken shÅbu</em>). âFacing a white sheet of paper, it is you who makes it [the calligraphy or the food] live or die.â<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> Interviews (in Japanese) with MyÅdÅ are easily accessible on YouTube. While she is no longer with us, we can still hear her deliver short sermons on âlifeâ and also sense that vivid life in her brushwork.</p>
