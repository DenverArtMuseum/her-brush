## Quire Default Theme

This default theme is a full-featured theme designed to showcase and make use of Quire’s core features out of the box, and is included by default when starting a new Quire project with the `quire new` command. The default theme includes support for a variety of page types: page, contents, cover, essay, entry, and splash. Also included are two sub-themes, "modern" (first three screenshots below) and "classic" (second three screenshots below), which can be controlled with the `$theme` variable as documented below.

The default theme is paired with the [default starter](https://github.com/thegetty/quire/starters/default) demo content, and is included when running `quire new`.

Consult [the Quire documentation](https://quire.getty.edu/) for more detailed information on publishing with Quire.

### Testing

The testing framework used for the `default-theme` is [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The cypress tests are run for every pull request through circleci. However if you are developing the `default-theme` you can run the tests locally also. This is possible by running `npm install` and then running `npm run test:e2e:local` from the `default-theme`directory.
